    "text": "The rock on which Freedom\n\n\nStumped its toe–\n\n\nThe great mistake\n\n\nThat Jamestown made\n\n\nLong ago\n\n\n— Langston Hughes\n\nWhenever I try to recall this poem, I search for “Plymouth Rock poem”, and freak out beacuse I can’t find it for a few seconds. This is because, all along, Hughes alludes to the founding of our nation without ever saying so. He points to our founding virtue, Freedom, and asks the reader to define it—suddenly—in their head. This question calls up our national myth, of virile men casting off the oppressive British yoke, which implants in Americans a desire for revolution and newness and independence.\nI find this desire each time I encounter American colonial history. There is the Massachusetts Bay colonizers, and the Virginia Company of London, more than anything else I want to race forward to 1776. American history teaching defaults to setting our cast of characters on the North American continent in order to reach revolution, with that noble end somehow justifying everything that came before (if not ethically, then morally: we suffered, and thus deserve Freedom). In the same way, the outposts of our frontiersmen and women served to legitimize the murder of indigenous people, conquest of Mexican territory, and deaths of our own colonizers.\nWhile this myth may be just that, it is a powerful story that is consistently told. Hughes rides its momentum, immediately clipping America’s great strides towards Freedom with the realities of chattel slavery. Nothing could be further from Freedom. But Hughes is acknowledging the promise of Freedom: one’s heart can’t break if it doesn’t first beat. By acknowledging the promise along with its failure, Hughes ties this heartbreak inextricably to our nation’s founding. This is the American heartbreak, bound up with the 400-year history of democracy in Jamestown. Hughes pulls us—with present tense, with reference to Jamestown, by describing something so hard, so immovable, so central to that other early colony—into the contradiction hidden in our nation’s founding, and still so hidden today."

    "title": "Just Mercy – a Legal Drama Adaptation That Fails to Do Justice to a Compelling Memoir",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Just Mercy’s most powerful scenes concern three different people condemned to death, all legally represented by Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan). These scenes punctuate the film, as we witness Stevenson’s growth from timid law student to successful advocate for those on death row. The strengths of Just Mercy—the eponymous memoir by Stevenson—lie in its plot and the range of lives contained within. But while the movie safely navigates the politics of portraying incarceration and gross injustice, it runs aground by bashing its viewership over the head by over-telling a story well shown.\nWe see, first, the timid intern some 800-miles south of Harvard to meet a man his own age on death row. We see, then, the execution of Herb Richardson, a veteran who developed PTSD during Vietnam and proceeded to detonate a bomb on a lover’s porch. Finally, we see Walter McMillan (Jamie Foxx) run the gauntlet of police and legal implements to win freedom for a crime he did not commit, that canonic Southern Sin of murdering a white woman whilst Black. This story dominates Just Mercy, and exposes features of the legal system in Monroeville, AL (the literary and extra-literary site of To Kill a Mockingbird) that the average viewer would not believe existed in the 1980s.\nJordan cracks the ‘rational’ suspicions of the first two inmates, seeming both cool-headed and eager. He is at his best showing off these gifts, gifts the real Bryan Stevenson possesses, of blind understanding and unflappability. The stories of these men evoke grief and frustration without the aid of embellishment, and Just Mercy refrains admirably in their cases. And it is mostly free from fetish, a necessity that prisoner-centric films still neglect. With Walter McMillan, however, Jordan plays somewhat different.\nFor Walter McMillan, Stephenson transforms into the Atticus Finch archetype he jokes about. I had hoped for a courtroom monologue-free drama—true to life—but Just Mercy just could not resist. Part of this discrepancy is a defect of the book-film transubstantiation: the book budgets roughly 10% of its pages to legal history and explaining the appeal process for Alabama death row inmates. Instead of devising some snappy montage (à la Michael Lewis film adaptations) explaining Alabama’s criminal processing and social statics showcasing racial disparities, Just Mercy, the movie, uses Jordan and legal assistant Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) as mouthpieces. What results are dialogues where both characters tell the other what they clearly already know. Just Mercy has not caught the trend of making its viewers think, spoon-feeding plot and context at its own expense.\nMoreover, Jordan says what doesn’t need to be said. When he visits McMillan’s family, extended family, and neighbors, it’s clear that Bryan Stevenson cares, that he goes beyond to help this man and his family, that he does not indict the men he sees (legally or illegally) on death row. Jordan uses his tremendously expressive face—clenched jaws and furrowed brows, or his 500-watt smile—to summon indignation or pleasure. He could very well have been the right actor for this movie, but his script sounds trite, due to his own delivery and adjustments, or to an overzealous writer/producer.\nHonestly, I think much of Just Mercy’s shortcomings fall on director Destin Daniel Cretton, though surely the suits at Warner Bros. pushed the platitudes whenever possible. I do not mind adaptations heightening the drama of a book, but they must pass a few criteria:\n\nMajor plot events represented faithfully: Here, the movie receives close to full marks. The first meeting on death row, execution, and first trial are close to perfect, but the release of Walter McMillan sees Stevenson lecturing the courtroom before judgment is passed. This is stupid as well as melodramatic; part of the book’s brilliance is its emphasis on how pedestrian structural racism and indigent defense is in the legal system.\nAdding to this mis-adaption is the portrayal of Monroeville’s prosecutor. Prosecutors have jobs, they have staffs, and they have electorates. These facts make their jobs less about justice than legal statistics and relationships with the police department. In the final 16 minutes, the prosecutor somehow turns from the patronizing careerist of the first two hours to sheepish moral man in full realization of his mistake. In reality, the state’s case was untenable. There was no uplifting realization by the white prosecutor that justice had not been served.\nThe adapted work’s environment communicated: This component is Just Mercy’s worst. The book leadens Stevenson’s journey with the twin histories of criminal prosecution and racism in America. As I mentioned before, the book resorts to chunky dialogue to explain basic facts of prosecution, but with no reference to the wider scope of these facts, no sense that these convictions happen in every jurisdiction in the United States.\nEmbellishments add to the message: I’m of two minds here. Jordan’s sermonizing belies Stevenson’s cool-headed determination. He was not Thurgood Marshall in the courtroom. But the adjustments to Walter McMillan’s incarceration were, at times, nice substitutes. Never in the book does Walter engage in a single aggressive or even energetic act. Here we see him thrashing against the human restraints that envelop him. The sense of rage, devoid in the book, is understandable.\n\nJust Mercy turns a book powerful for its facticality into something expected and over-determined. No one who reads the facts of this case would have the need to decipher, yet the all-too-familiar scenes of excessive force and righteousness of Michael B. Jordan as Bryan Stevenson are so obviously coded as to rob any viewers of their right to interpretation. The movie wins when getting out of its own way, offering the un-cinematic particularities (a scratchy record full of dread just before the electric chair) and plain humanity (Stevenson joking with his first client, about what he won’t say) of, you know, real humans. It is a poignant story of what it means for anyone with a modicum of power to remember the wrongs that have already happened instead of trying to inscribe their own story ignorant of what has come before. But check out the book instead from your local library."

    "section": "",
    "text": "No review—drawn inevitably from the vocabulary and lessons of preceding films—will do the novelty and creativity of Bong Joon-ho’s masterpiece justice. Parasite is the best film to be released since Mad Max: Fury Road, possibly since 12 Years a Slave. Parasite’s uncanny setting makes possible its combination of comedy and horror that justifies the second act’s shocking twists. In this way, it can be seen as the Korean and class counterpart to Get Out, with more emphasis on the realism than the horror.\nThe film is set in a contemporary Metropolis: its sprawling poverty serves the hermetically-sealed homes of the super-rich. Bong dances over the border between these realms, following—classically—the help that enters and exits these homes daily. In the title credits, we watch a drunk piss on the English basement-home of our star family, who are unemployed and failing to keep up with the vagaries of capitalism. When an unexpected chance to tutor at the home of a super-rich family opens, our family jumps at the opportunity. This first hour is a riot. Full of wit, we see them exploit the naïvete of the super-rich, locating the meaning behind ‘parasite’.\nBut Parasite’s trick is its information imbalances. In Act I, our family colludes to carve out for themselves a way to live. Act II see-saws back this imbalance. Events begin to happen to our family rather than by our family. Still, Bong doesn’t shroud us in a JJ Abrams information fog, with terrors leaping out from dark corners of the screen. Instead, we see how the super-rich, themselves, feed off Korea’s underclass, dictating their schedule, their names, their words. Their financial insecurity keeps them in the thrall of this rich family, and pushes them to box out any competitors. These economically-violent delights have physically-violent ends. Where many films inspect class, the invisible fence that separates rich and poor, this film inspects wealth’s first derivative, inequality: we watch in real time as those invisible fences are built. Parasite shows how the cherries that top the artisanal cakes drip with the blood of the poor."

    "text": "But, as people use a currency less, its legitimacy drops: those who accept bolivars for dollars demand higher and higher rates in return; Zelle (and other mobile payments providers with access to dollars) facilitate dollar spot trading for the masses. Venezuelans are effectively hastening the bolivar’s demise. Now, it is important to keep in mind that consumer transactions rarely add up to much when compared to large-value settlements by banks and governments, but the effect is there. Bloomberg reported that some XX% of Venezuelans maintain a foreign bank account, and a straw poll of Caracas retailers indicates that YY% accept Zelle.\nMobile payment providers have democratized and sped monetary policy in Venezuela. One would expect Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s anti-American president, to curse as the national currency slips away in favor of the dollar. However, Maduro welcomed this development. >“I don’t see it as a bad thing … this process that they call ‘dollarization,’” he said during a November 2019 TV broadcast, adding, “thank God it exists!”\nWe have here the rare phenomenon that a government accepts the instability of its currency without providing its own alternative. Transactions bewteen Venezuelan governments and officials still legally proceed in bolivars—Trump administration sanctions have US accounts connected to thousands of officials—but an estimated 60% of transactions in the country use greenbacks now. This modifies the vision of monetary regulation articulated by Karl Polanyi in The Great Transformation. Polanyi saw the welfare state, land reform, and the fiats that valued currencies as scenes in the second act of a great ‘double movement’.\nIn general, a double movement is the powerful destabilization of area thought to be fixed, followed by the frenzied creation of a mechanism to regulate that space. Specifically, destabilizations in land, labor, and money wrought by the rise of the market economy in Second Industrial Revolution–era Britain attracted Polanyi. The Great Transformation made important contributions to anthropology—detailing how the market economy produced a mental shift not unlike Weber’s process of rationalization—but let’s stay fixed to his account of the birth of monetary regulation. Essentially, classic liberals agreed into existence the intellectual atmosphere necessary for economic liberalization: >What made economic liberalism an irresistible force was this congruence of opinion between diametrically opposed outlooks; for what the ultrareformer Bentham and the ultratraditionalist Burke equally approved of automatically took on the character of self-evidence.1\nYet, to create a truly laissez-faire system is to create ‘fictitious commodities’, to subject things which cannot fluctuate like commodities to the same market discipline. The chaos of the Second Industrial Revolution ensued, pulling people into the conditions Engels described in Manchester, scuffing up the land with mining tracts, and eroding people’s sense of stability by inflation and deflation. After all the careful treatises, pamphlets, and speeches, people did not want to deal with the self-adjusting market. Where “Laissez-faire was planned, planning was not.”2\nHis account lands most viscerally when he discusses the welfare policies made for people, but it extends to money as well: >central banking and the management of the monetary system were needed to keep manufactures and other productive enterprises safe from the harm involved in the commodity fiction as applied to money. Paradoxically enough, not human beings and natural resources only but also the organization of capitalistic production itself had to be sheltered from the devastating effects of a self-regulating market.3 To reduce it a great deal, businesses like stability, but a market-oriented approach to money actually involves a great deal of instability once foreign exchange is added to the equation. In the Second Industrial Revolution, the source of instability, the commodity that was so fictional, was the gold standard.4 Some economic historians point to the gold standard’s breakdown, and then to economies’ subsequent deflations and tightenings of credit as the trigger of the Great Depression. Polanyi did too, and the connection with the greatest modern economic catastrophe served his purposes in The Great Transformation. As a result of the Depression, nations adopted ‘token currency’, which today we still have.\nUp to this point, Polanyi’s relatively ancient history could also describe Venezuela’s relatively recent. In brief, a commodity-backed money (in this case, oil) wreaks terrible damage on business and the populace by its wild gyrations. In this case, the terror is inflation instead of deflation, but damage is still inflicted—who the winners and losers are is reversed, if for only a short while. But Maduro’s approval of the dollarization distinguishes now from then. Polanyi writes of a resurgent nationalism that takes a country’s currency as its emblem: >the new nationalism was the corollary of the new internationalism. […] The national token currency was the certain safeguard of this relative security since it allowed the central bank to act as a buffer between the internal and the external economy.5\nIn contrast, Maduro relinquishes nationalism for the external economy. Is this internationalism? American hegemony? It depends if you look at the dollar simply as the reserve currency of the world, or tack on its role in US global power, tending toward hegemony. Regardless of the particular label, Maduro’s declaration was incongruous with his nationalism in other spheres of policy. I would interpret this to agree with Bloomberg’s take that “Venezuelans’ embrace of digital money is less a matter of choice than of necessity”, but that would seem to argue that Venezuela’s troubles tended inevitably to acquiescence to the dollar. Instead, I want to emphasize that different governments react in different ways depending on their priority. Despite Maduro’s dictatorial tendencies (and they can’t be ironed over), I think his admission grasps the reality of Venezuela’s situation and a possible “escape valve” (his words) for the country.\nI ascribe agency, and—therefore—intent to Maduro’s admission because another country facesa very similar situtation, but has dealt with it much differently. For me the demonstration of two different approaches to the same problem is enough to poke holes in any account of the situation that claims inevitability. However, this line of reasoning must be weighed against the fact that inflation is not (currently) as bad in this country. Zimbabwe has played host to the world’s worst inflation for most of the new millennium, but the recent figures total in the hundreds of percent, not tens of thousands. In July, the president accused the CEO of Econet, Zimbabwe’s largest mobile payments operator, with conspiring to undermine the country’s dollar peg. This accusation is made all the more serious with the fact that about 90% of transactions take place through Econet. It looks as though the process differs slightly from that in Venezuela—instead of sending dollars through US bank accounts, Zimbabweans have physical dollars (or assets denominated in dollars) and trade Zollars—but the idea is the same.\nThat this is Zimbabwe’s second attempt to ditch the (US) dollar in spite of national disfavour shows the national mindset at work here. These two cases remind us how attractive a national currency can be, but also how tragically impractical. Mobile payment providers facilitate and hasten old instabilities, leaving little room for fixed-rate currencies to thrive. It’s unclear whether Polanyi’s conception of states strong enough to rein in their markets applied when he wrote The Great Transformation, but it certainly does not now. And you can bet that central banks are looking to Zimbabwe and Venezuela with anxiety, even though this scale of collapse requires more than just disruptive mobile payments. I believe this fear is why regulators have thrown bureaucratic wrenches into the last-minute developments of promising startups and Facebook/WhatsApp’s Libra.6\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n“Political Economy and the Discovery of Society”.

    "title": "Distortion in Vertigo (1958)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hitchcock’s cinematographic style changes with each script and year in which he immerses himself, unlike the storybook qualities of Wes Anderson or the placid Drops dripped of Andrei Tarkovsky. Vertigo, at the dizzying heights of Hitchcock’s mastery, leads us into John Ferguson’s (James Stewart) mind—distorted by the lethal, dozen-story fall of a partner trying to save Ferguson—by forcing us into cramped spaces and mocking our spatial judgment. I argue that in doing so, Hitchcock forces viewers to understand the disorientation and claustrophobia that Ferguson so clearly feels. In doing so, Hitchcock makes reasonable the otherwise unreasonable male gaze of Ferguson and, by association, the effects that gaze causes, though it’s unclear whether it serves to morally justify that gaze. So, in-movie, Hitchcock uses film technique to warp what would otherwise be a black-and-white judgment about Ferguson’s behavior towards Judy Barton (Kim Novak). Out-of-movie, I finally make the claim that this in-movie phenomenon critiques white American masculinity’s treatment of the Other.\nMuch of this analysis was impossible for me until I considered David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive—there were too many motifs in Vertigo to grab a hold of! Hitchcock employs a contrasting color palette, his signature(ly disturbing) perplexion with blonde women, and an unforgettable break in narrative. Mulholland offers those motifs amped up to surrealistic proportions, with color palettes at near antagonistic levels, the blondes shining ever more platinum, though its narrative break is difficult to pinpoint. Connecting Mulholland Drive and Vertigo makes the interpretation of Hitchcock’s film no easier, but facilitates a shift in mindset that rendered Vertigo much more interpretable.\nI mean this: Lynch is enigmatic as hell, but he continues to give interviews. In these interviews, he surrenders much of his creativity to what he terms “dream-logic”, and it stands out immediately. Dream-logic connects two objects despite their inconsistencies according to logic-logic. Such an approach finds its Western roots entirely recent, coming primarily out of Sigmund Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams. Its epistemology is usually visual in [Lynch’s] movies, though connections via homonym or punnery are entirely within the bounds of Freudian analysis. While a novelty in 2001 Mulholland Drive premiered, 1958 saw psychoanalysis at its peak of influence. This rise crashed into Hitchcock’s prior work with film noir, convoluted plots that often involved damaged detectives and female subjects vulnerable physically and mentally.\nVertigo synthesizes these two strands. Kim Novak’s characters—one before, one after the narrative break—vie for their freedom against their supposed history. In classic Hitchcock fashion, Vertigo can be summarized as a Wrong Man Film,1 where the protagonist is mistaken for a doppelgänger implicated in deep, deep shit. Unclassically, Vertigo’s protagonist is no man; and its protagonist(s) is/are not its central character(s). Novak’s Judy Barton is modeled (mostly) against her will after a prior, dead San Francisco socialite, Madeleine Ester,2 who herself models a [much more] prior, dead San Francisco socialite. The complicity of each in creating their respective iron cloaks of identity is uncertain, but beside the point—Ferguson’s male gaze visualizes these identities before they are realized.\nOften enough, the male gaze is analyzed as a whole, apart from its sometimes very specific set of eyes. I get at Ferguson’s specific set through Hitchcock’s motifs and cinematography. Ferguson’s gaze is set very literally in the film’s opening. Hitchcock shakes up the presumably keen vision of a detective with his partner’s death. The fall and the height and the guilt confuse themselves in Ferguson’s head to deliver a crippling case of vertigo, rendering him unproductive and idle, unmoored from his former senses of intelligence. There is nothing objective against which Ferguson can mark the damage his trauma wrought, no other detectives to which he can compare.\nHitchock will signify this psychosis slowly at first, then all at once. This chronological pattern approximates the spiral imagery so fundamental to Vertigo. Saul Bass’ iconic movie poster design depicts Ferguson plunging into a line-drawn spiral. This third dimension is added, and reflects the way objects track in wide-diameter circles, speeding as the circles shrink and finally encloses the object.3 Concerned of the obsession his wife (Madeleine) exhibits for a suicidal ancestor, Ferguson’s friend sends him to play private detective. While Scottie takes logical steps to follow the wife’s story, his social isolation and physical trauma get the better of him. His steps culminate in a famous leap into the brisk San Francisco Bay, where, just before, Madeleine plunged, unconscious.\n\n\n\nVertigo’s massive field of view.\n\n\nAfter the dive in, James Ferguson can never quite get himself on solid ground. The spiral patterns begin to crop up in paintings, department stores, cemeteries, etc.\n\n\n\nThe tight spiral of Madeleine, her ancestor, and eventually Judy connects the three in Ferguson’s dream-logic.\n\n\nCaught in the inner circles of a deepening plot and deepening conspiracy, Hitchcock simulates what Ferguson’s deepening psychosis4 must feel like with cinematographic trickery that encloses Ferguson’s figure, disclosing the craze lurking inside his obsessed mind. In Vertigo’s camerawork, deep focus and a 2-D plane forces our visual cortex to compare the near and far. The video below demonstrates this several times.\n\nThose yellow flowers that Scottie walks behind at 1:59 appear taller than him in that moment, and the obscured view traps his figure in the history, mystery, and death that linger after Novak exits the scene. Hitchcock further unsettles viewers in :17, not with the normal technique of a dolly following Ferguson and suggesting danger, but with a shot from below. This camera setting exaggerates the height and length of objects outside focal point, making the 3ft flowers equal the 6ft Ferguson in height. The mastery here is the unresolved tension between these instances of camera trickery and Hitchcock’s concurrent attention to truly large objects. The enormity of the Golden Gate bridge in one famous shot anchors the nearly surreal imagery elsewhere in Vertigo, cementing a permanent unease.\nAdd this to the geologic folding that turns ordinary car following into labyrinthine mazes:\n\nAnd of course, Vertigo’s signature camera effect, the zoom-in/dolly-out:\n\nThe spirals (2:13), the huge objects (:36), the zoom-in/dolly-out (1:20) culminate in Vertigo’s quasi-climax:\n\nThe scene in Mission San Juan Bautista also bears striking resemblances to the work of Italian surrealist Giorgio de Chirico. De Chirico’s work produces a sense of unease through its emphasis on the uncanny, that which is not quite and yet almost is. I like to think of a composite image, the subimages of which are all perfectly possible, though the composite somehow not being possible. In the image below, which reminds me both of the Mission and the ever-out-of-reach Madeleine, the sky is a natural color for sunsets and the long shadows possible at twilight, but the building is so bright and the shadows so stark that the image could not possibly depict a real event. Hitchcock, toeing the sur/realism line, never leaves us with quite the uncanny images or impossible geometries to prove the sort of dream-logic that Lynch would make explicit, but these scenes add up. With snaking streets, out-of-proportion objects, and color palette, builds a profile of the uncanny without ever letting us put a finger on it. Like Ferguson, the viewer is hard-pressed to resolve the visual inputs Hitchcock offers.\n\n\n\nGiorgio de Chirico’s Metaphysical Art movement\n\n\nThis kind of confusion invites resolution for the viewer into a reality-less vacuum. Similarly, while Ferguson is a detective, used to getting to the Bottom of Things, he can’t in this situation. All his preternatural detective powers have been duped by trauma and deceit. He is painfully aware which way is up and which down, but not much beyond that. Through all the twists and turns, Ferguson never understands (or rather, never is able to convince himself he understands) Madeleine. The history (of Madeleine, of Dolores, etc.) regresses too far for his eyes to penetrate. Unable to free himself from this convoluted plot and detached from reality, Ferguson imposes a narrative on Judy. He can’t figure out the mystery, so he might as well write his own answer. And the viewer accepts this to some degree because the story is resolution-deficient. Trapped staring through Ferguson’s gaze, escape is—depending on the specific viewer—to some extent preferable, even when it carries such gross implications.\nThe endgame of Ferguson’s gaze is sex. The male gaze conjures scenarios—no matter how fantastical—where legally-consensual5 sex occurs, and relates those scenarios with the real world in order to judge their plausibility, filtering those implausible scenarios from the gazer’s strategies. A plausible scenario would mean that Ferguson has successfully dissected her, inducting her motives, and—with them in hand—smooth-talked her into thinking that his motives overlap with hers. But since Ferguson cannot understand Judy, because he cannot relate fantasy with reality, he resorts to the truly outrageous step of realizing those fantastical scenarios and their absurd bargaining power disparities, molding Judy so that her [perceived] motives can be induced to comport with Ferguson’s desires. This decision fabricates the conscience-satisfying, superficially-consensual sex that ends Vertigo. Horrifically, the viewers’ interests are sympathetic to Ferguson’s, begging for plot resolution, but are then [hopefully] spoiled when they are confronted with the idea that their interests imply the exploitation of Judy. From beneath the comfort of 1950’s American entertainment, a violent man watches.\nIn interpreting the greater significance of Vertigo, I benefit again from viewing Hitchcock through Lynch’s rear window:\n\nMy childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it’s supposed to be. But on the cherry tree there’s this pitch oozing out – some black, some yellow, and millions of red ants crawling all over it. I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are always red ants underneath.6\n\nHitchcock views America somewhat from the outside. He picks a very particular part of the US, one where the histories of people who were not British is readily apparent in depictions of frontier life (and Native death). This choice primarily works to operate on the level of uncanny history, a history that few are equipped to read completely into their own history of America, but with pieces that all can recognize. It’s therefore both easy to dissociate Ferguson’s particular position from their own, while difficult to completely disentangle the silver screen from real life. Stewart’s roles prior to Vertigo included US everyman turned Congressman in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, aviator Charles Lindbergh in The Spirit of St. Louis, a cowboy in Winchester ’73, George Bailey in It’s a Wonderful Life. I cannot think of another actor who so embodied rich, moral American-ness during this time. Hitchcock then takes apart this rich, moral, American figure by finding within him obsession, formidable sexuality, and desperation. A bit of psychological trauma sets off (or reveals?) the ants in this cherry tree. More specifically, the bent of America is towards taking that which/who is not ours and assimilating them, without dealing with “underlying” issues.\nI find it difficult to read Hitchcock as directing in so critical a fashion as I have just suggested, given the patent fetishism of Kim Novak’s characters. In that vein, I would echo the interpretation of American men above, but stop short of believing Hitchcock to be fully critical. For him, I don’t think the discomfort of Judy’s situation outweighs his fetish for Novak. While Vertigo is a unique instance of 1950’s filmmaking for its unsettling features and early integration of psychoanalysis, I’m not convinced of any allegations of intent on Hitchcock’s part. It very well may be that old Alfred was the astute critic I have made him to be, but it could equally (in my eyes) be the case that he was utterly obsessed with Novak. To resolve Vertigo’s interpretation would be to impose, for all but the most ardent individualist, an idea of its meaning absent context of its author. While I generally distance myself from arguments about authorial intent, I do not want to foreclose the possibility of its import to other viewers.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\ncf. The Wrong Man (1956)↩︎\nNovak in ~Act 1~.↩︎\nCf.

    "text": "Though it offers no plot or characters that could create tension in a conventional story structure, Rabbits is seriously intriguing, and hints at larger, unobserved meanings. This intrigue is not uncommon; in fact, my theory of late has been that Lynch understands that his viewers feel the hints and the suggestions at something grander, his films all metaphysical McGuffins. In his films, characters do not look at one another—they see, in flashy close-ups, the uncertain eyes of the other. Leading women are never conventionally pretty—they are fantastically upbeat and implausibly platinum, hysterical results of Hollywood insecure appeal to men’s wallets. Cars do not traverse from point to point—headlights sprint over dark, twisting roadways. These are cinematic clichés, style that heightens substance when it is used eagerly and genuinely.\n\n\n\nSet of Rabbits. The camera moves from this fixed position exactly once to zoom in on the telephone.\n\n\nBut there is nothing substantive about Rabbits: Lynch’s mastery over cinematic cliché is taken to the brink, and over. In many Lynch films since Blue Velvet, characters utter non-sequiters in total deadpan; but in Rabbits, they utter nothing but non-sequiters, with no story to speak of! This Baldametti score then adds style to substanceless grunts, sounds English speakers will recognize as words but not as meaningful sentences. And with some serious hilarity, Lynch adds a sitcom applause over the entrances of each character into this one-room apartment and laughtracks after sentences like “It is 7pm” and “I almost forgot.” These outbursts, audio cues to at-home viewers that Important or Funny happenings are taking place, mock TV shows like the Big Bang Theory, whose live audiences treat academic jargon and references to comic books as the basis for side-splitting guffaws.\nThe distance between the intelligibility of plot in Rabbits and the connotations of its audio cues emphasize the contingency of language and the ability of convention to invent meaning from nothing. It is indisputable that Baldametti’s score is ominous, alerting viewers that Something Is Happening, or that audience laughter is comedic, alerting viewers that a Joke Is Occurring. But simply because a connotation is indisputable does not make it true. None would dispute the scores ominousness or the audiences laughter because the years of TV and film that we have watch have taught us to connect certain sounds to certain moments. The work starts with children’s tales, where morality is stark and the audio cues used to reinforce a grand, unified message. By grounding these otherwise unintelligible cues in extra-cinematic morality or realistic emotions, we learn to couple low, industrial sounds with alertness, and human laughter with comedy. Rabbits attempts to elicit those emotions by only employing the signifier, while ditching the plot points signified.\n\n\n\nThe Persona-like dream sequences. Nothing says for sure these rabbits sleep, but shifts in color and a demonic face that hovers in the upper left-hand corner match dream sequences in Lynch’s other films.\n\n\nPerhaps one can argue that the words which immediately precede and follow the Persona-like interpolated dream sequences are Important, but I am not convinced. I propose that Rabbits is David Lynch toying with us. He wants to know if he can make pure entertainment, works without useful or familiar stories, but which nonetheless strap us into rollercoasters of joy, despair, nostalgia, and humor. In his other works, this plays out seamlessly. I (the viewer) achingly try to pin down the plot, and then the meaning of the narrative he created. This process feels possible, but always out-of-reach in his other works, which ditch the rabbit heads and opt for sequences of dialog that I recognize as events and narrative momentum. But in Rabbits, the dissonance between signifier and signified makes the effect clear. In Rabbits, the laughter and music become parodic, pointing at the fact that in all language, cinematic or otherwise, our grunts are intelligible for no reasons other than Pavolvian repitition and the magic fizz of neurons. Language is contingent, subject to chance mutation and adoption, and not subject to deep structures or extra-personal validity."

    "title": "Federal Reserve further expands access to Municipal Liquidity Facility",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On June 3, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors unanimously approved a second expansion of eligibility under its Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF).\nAuthorized by the CARES Act, the MLF can purchase up to $500 billion of newly-issued bonds from qualifying municipalities, using funds from the Fed and Treasury. Until this latest action, the MLF had restricted the eligibility of cities and counties based only on their population. The newest terms guarantee the eligibility of at least two political subdivisions and two revenue-bond issuers from each state.\nThe expansion comes after the Fed once again weathered criticism from state governors and representatives that the MLF’s eligibility criteria were too narrow. The original MLF criteria designated states, the District of Columbia, cities larger than one million residents, counties larger than two million residents, and one revenue-bond issuer (such as a utility or transit authority) per state as the only eligible recipients.\nIn effect, the original term sheet ceded borrowing privileges to just 10 cities and 16 counties. The Federal Reserve at the time said states could funnel the proceeds from bond sales to smaller cities and counties whose budgets had been strained by the effects of the novel coronavirus.\nBut this approach, while preserving the Fed’s historical distance from small borrowers, ran into several issues. For instance, some states lack the organizational infrastructure to lend to cities and counties. More importantly, several states face legal impediments to borrowing. Twenty-one states require referenda to issue debt at levels demanded by COVID-19 disruptions, while a previous YPFS blogpost noted that several more states require legislative supermajorities to push through bond issuances. The current situation presents unique challenges to meeting such requirements, given that social distancing demands have closed many governing bodies and forestalled the possibilities of voting. In many cases, safe alternatives have not yet been designed.\nMembers of Congress criticized the Fed’s narrow interpretation of the CARES Act, which did not specify eligibility criteria for the MLF. The Fed’s first expansion on April 27 extended the program from September 30 to December 31, and lowered the eligibility thresholds from 1 million residents per city and 2 million residents per county to 500,000 and 1 million, respectively. As a result, the total number of eligible cities and counties increased from 26 to 227. However, even under the amended criteria, several states still lacked a single municipality that met the population threshold.\nThe June 3 terms lowered the thresholds again to 250,000 residents per city and 500,000 residents per county. Should a state lack one or two municipalities that meet these thresholds, governors may designate one or two of the largest ineligible cities or counties. Governors may also designate two non-governing entities that currently issue bonds secured by government revenue. Additionally, multi-state revenue-bond issuers, such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, are now also eligible issuers, provided that minimum credit rating thresholds are met.\nThe Fed has not changed the original terms regarding the MLF’s size, and eligible uses of funds. The facility is authorized to purchase up to $500 billion in eligible bonds (allocated among the states as proportions of FY2017 general revenue), and is backstopped by an equity investment of $35 billion from the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, as authorized by the CARES Act. The facility takes the form of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established by the Fed under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The facility may purchase “tax anticipation notes (TANs), tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs), bond anticipation notes (BANs), revenue anticipation notes (RANs),” and similar bonds with maturities no longer than 36 months, funding up to 20% of a state, county, city, or revenue-bond issuer’s revenue.\nSmall cities are particularly sensitive to economic shocks due to their dependence on sales tax. Brookings reported that cities in the Midwest, generally smaller than those in the dense East and heavily urbanized West, rely more on sales taxes. Whereas property values are assessed not more than once a year, and income taxes are filed annually, sales tax receipts enter municipal finances at frequencies varying between once a month and once a year. These higher-frequency collections mean that shocks affect sales tax revenues much more quickly than other types of taxes.\nCompounding pressure on the MLF to purchase small-city debt are high-population thresholds and use restrictions on CARES Act grants. Under the Coronavirus Relief Fund, only municipalities with 500,000 residents or more are eligible and funds may only be used for necessary and unexpected expenditures demanded by COVID-19. Thus, monies cannot be used to compensate for reduced sales tax receipts, a use that is permissable for proceeds from MLF bond purchases.\nThe MLF marks the first time the Federal Reserve has waded into direct purchases of municipal bonds. In 2011, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, Republicans in both chambers balked at suggestions from Democrats that the federal government bail out municipalities. The then-Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said that the Fed had “no expectation or intention to get involved in state and local finance.” The Fed’s legal authority to buy municipal bonds extended to only 2% of the market, and Bernanke noted that there might be other legal restrictions under the Dodd-Frank Act.\nBut, in spite of the Fed’s historic distance from municipal debt, the efficacy of the MLF may lead to deeper involvement in municipal finances. The initial announcement of the MLF in April immediately stabilized a $4 trillion market that saw AAA yields jump from just under 1% to just under 3% in a matter of days.\nPolitico pointed to House Ways & Means Chair Richard Neal as a catalyst for more intervention in munis. Even before the novel coronavirus, the former mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts, had established himself as a supporter of municipal bonds. However, aid may instead come from traditional fiscal policy routes should the Fed hold firm on its new eligibility thresholds. Neal represents Springfield and its enclosing county Hampden, each of which just miss these newest MLF population thresholds.\nThus far, Illinois is the only state to announce its participation in the MLF, issuing $1.2 billion in 12-month maturities at 3.82%.The MLF became operational on May 26."

    "text": "Additionally, the choice of project can reflect an entry programmer’s motivations and experience. One jump that’s important to make from academia is understanding that not everything needs to be created from the ground up. In college, creating a new club was a checkbox for those climbing the prestige ladder. In true UVA fashion, this urge was even present in student organizing—there’s a pipeline from organizing to Deloitte that’s as thick as organizing to professional organizing/unions/law school—and I often saw students choose the easy path of starting a new club instead of the hard work improving what already existed. Working with structures, forums, and people that are already available is a far more powerful option, though it can take difficult politicking to do so.\nIn open-source, licenses limit how proprietary people can be about their creations. And no one awards points for already-built pieces of software (unless they cross languages). So, to build open-source incentivizes answering new problems and using already-made tools. To build an API client in R today, you don’t need a great knowledge of HTTP responses; you just need httr. You don’t even need to know how to unnest JSONs, you just need as.data.frame(). What you do need, is a sense of what problems still need solutions, and how to find those solutions quickly (that’s where the other tools step in).\nValet, the Bank of Canada’s API, did not have an R client when the YPFS was studying its COVID work, and I pretty much stick to R. So, to demonstrate that I could build a solution quickly, without reinventing the wheel, I wrote valet, which was just accepted by CRAN! It covers all of the API’s endpoints, so importing datasets to R is a reproducible breeze. This project also taught me about the infrastructure of package development:\n\ndocumentation\ntesting\nsubmission\n\nAs you’d expect, Hadley’s book covers it all in great detail, so I won’t describe my process. I’ll just say that I am blown away at the comprehensiveness of the R ecosystem for package development and maintenance:\n\nRoxygen for documenting packages inline with the actual functions\ntestthat for writing easy-to-understand tests\ndevtools for checking against R’s technical requirements, building documentation, and submitting\npkgdown for making documentation websites with no added effort (okay, a little bit of understanding GitHub Actions/Pages)\nusethis for a million myriad add-ons and timesavers\n\nIn my mind, it’s these components that allow people with no formal training to release helpful, useful packages. The only limit to the number of good packages should be the number of good ideas.\nNext up for me is to really understand Docker: when to use…how to use…and why does it take 2GB on my computer?"

    "text": "I thought this was a phenomenon entirely local to myself until I saw this article from Aeon, noting that life management has become a juggernaut in consumer retail, with “self-care and anti-stress products now rounding out the bestseller list on Amazon”. We’ve reined in other animals, organizations of people, and our bodies by calibrating each measurable parameter, so why not do the same for our minds? Unfortunately, we don’t seem quite as pliant as the optimization equations imply.\nThis logic, made inexorable by limitless access to information, tugs at our happiness. Behind whatever tool or activity or person present before us lurks an alternative, a next-best option. This idea has driven every rationalist attempt at decision making, but its actual calculus has changed considerably since the 1990s. Before then, catalogued libraries and television delivered then-unprecedented access to information. The task of research had become immediately more accessible, but also less clear. Suddenly, more and more causes sprang up to explain each effect.\nThe move from card catalogues and TV to Wikipedia and on-demand streaming was a leap in this dimension. Different from past moves was the sheer scale of new information. The closest comparison to make would likely be the telegram that could relay news around the world in minutes, but that did not solve the last-mile problem that our phones and computers did. Similar to past moves is the growing illusion of choice. Most definitions model illusory choice as a free decision between a constrained set of options, like choosing from a soda machine that offers a dozen brands but where every choice is a Coca-Cola product. But rather than onstrained options, I interpret illusory choice as constrained decisions.\nOur brain budgets time and resources based on prior neurological sequences, updating expectations with each iteration. While we may understand how normal it is not to find an exhaustive cost-benefits comparison of the more than 2,000 results for “thimble” on Amazon, our brains may not. Our expectations have been conditioned by the norms of evidence-based administration to treat anything less than exhaustive comparisons as failure. This extends to our lives, where exhaustive comparison has meant nothing less than exhaustion. Where once, exhaustive comparisons meant eyeballing dozens, now it means eyeballing hundreds, thousands, or millions.\nOur internal search processes can’t handle such scale. While they have gradually widened, the velocity of extension by the market has effectively capped the rate at which we had to develop non-exhaustive ways to search. When the village had a single cobbler, shoes were a constant, not a variable to optimize over. Still, when there are ten types of black beans at the grocery store, they can be compared quite readily. But when it’s always possible to opt for peer-to-peer sellers in Kolkata over the local Walmart, people are given the room every day to exhaust their critical thinking skills trying to gauge the expected payoffs of a hundred options, and a million more they know to be lurking, accessible to anyone with the right search terms.\nOur minds haven’t caught up yet. They can take on waves of epic proportions, but a tide that lifts them high enough to see the world’s ginormity will overwhelm. I see two ways out: time and pragmatism. The first just says that after enough time passes, our minds will adjust, will think in different ways to approach this different problem. But that option offers only consolation to people currently. Option two offers that different way. Construct in your mind a noble lie, something appealing but fanciful. Then, believe in it.\nAdhering to a set of values fixes those variables as constants. This is Marie Kondo for your mind, with the tiny caveat that beliefs weigh far more than shower organizers, dressers, or homes. The values chosen don’t have to conform to Marie Kondo–like advice. In fact, choosing something already at tension with what FastCompany promises are the best ways to increase productivity is probably best. It’s good training for the future. Rather, pick values that will let you do the most of your wants, your in-the-moment pleasures. Do not conflate ‘do the most’ with ‘most choices’. To do the most, you need clear boundaries that, if crossed, bind you to decisions, decisions that you could theoretically even come to regret, but decisions that you need to make. Pragmatism means believing what needs to be believed, even if it can’t stand up to rationalist inquiry."

The new facility will complement the ECB’s current bilateral swap lines by allowing for less stable currencies to participate in repurchase agreements.

    "text": "Fed swap lines remain successful\nSince the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Fed has maintained unlimited swap lines with the European Union, England, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. On March 23, it began offering daily, 7-day tenor swaps on these unlimited lines. This development came on the heels of a March 19 expansion of bilateral agreements detailed by a previous YPFS blogpost: the expanded facility would provide up to $60 billion for the banks of Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, and Sweden, and up to $30 billion for the banks of Denmark, Norway, and New Zealand.\nDuring a dollar liquidity swap, the Fed enters into an agreement with another central bank that maintains an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY). The banks agree to perform two actions: first, the Fed’s dollars are exchanged for the foreign bank’s currency at the prevailing exchange rate; second, at some specified date in the near future, the foreign bank’s dollars are re-exchanged for their own currency at the same exchange rate as the original transaction, plus a small interest rate. The FRBNY is authorized by the Fed’s Open Market Committee under Section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act to establish swap lines, and has emphasized the benefits to American households and businesses by ”helping to maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses by reducing risks to U.S. financial markets caused by financial stresses abroad.”\nSince the agreements peg both transactions to the same exchange rate, the Fed bears no risk that turmoil in foreign exchange markets translates to a loss of US dollars. Foreign central banks often use swap lines to get dollars that they can use to provide liquidity to domestic institutions in need of dollars. In 2007, the Fed lent money directly to US branches of European banks in addition to its heavy usage of the swap lines. The upshot of a liquidity swap was that, since the Fed’s swap was with the other central bank, it was not exposed to the risk of default by the downstream borrowing institutions; this risk was borne by the central bank, which determined who it would lend to.\nThough financial strains among countries with standing dollar swap lines have thus far been much weaker than during the GFC, the rejuvenated lines were equally effective at quelling turbulent dollar funding markets. Between March 6 and March 23, the US trade-weighted dollar index jumped to an historical high of 126.47, and posted its largest single-day percentage increase since the series was inaugurated in January 2006. With the acceleration of 7-day swaps on March 23, three days later the index subsequently posted its second largest drop since March 2009. It has not fluctuated by more than 1 point since April 7, though the index has remained higher and more volatile than recent, pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse) #plotting, data wrangling\nlibrary(lubridate) #dates\n\ntradewt <- fredr(series_id = \"DTWEXBGS\", units = \"pch\") #retreive percent change in daily trade-weighted US dollar index using fredr\nrecessions <- read_csv(\"start, end\n2007-12-01, 2009-06-01\n2020-02-01, NA\") #add recessions from https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/fred/data/understanding-the-data/recession-bars/\nrecessions[nrow(recessions), 2] <- Sys.Date() #update current recession with today's date\n\nggplot(tradewt) +\n  geom_line(aes(date, value), color = \"#286dc0\", show.legend = F) + #line plot of trade-weighted US dollar index\n  geom_rect(data = mutate(filter(recessions, end >= min(tradewt$date)), #only include recessions ending after start of series\n                          start = if_else(start < min(tradewt$date), min(tradewt$date), start)), #trim start of overhanging recession\n            aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), #define sides of rectangle\n            fill = \"#978d85\", #Yale shading color\n            alpha = .33) + #opacity\n  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0), date_breaks = \"2 years\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(date, value, label = datestring), data = mutate(slice_max(tradewt, order_by = abs(value), n = 6), datestring = format(date, \"%b %d\")), min.segment.length = 0, label.padding = .1, segment.alpha = .6, show.legend = F, color = \"#4a4a4a\") +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Percent change\", title = \"Daily change in trade-weighted US dollar index, 2006 - 2020\", subtitle = \"Shaded areas indicate recessions, and six largest one-day swings are labeled\", caption = \"Source: Federal Reserve Board of Governors\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#00356b\", vjust = -2), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#00356b\", vjust = -1), plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#4a4a4a\"), plot.margin = margin(r = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(color = \"#222222\"), axis.text = element_text(color = \"#4a4a4a\"), axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"#222222\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"#dddddd\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed and authority with which the Fed provides liquidity for the largest reserve currency market have bolstered the central bank’s reputation. This most recent resurgence of swap lines has led some to assert that the Fed is not only a central bank to the US, but also to the world, offering short-term emergency liquidity when central banks – liquid in their own currency – are strapped for US dollars. As with domestic lender-of-last-resort operations, the transactions have always been initiated by a counterparty, never by the Fed. Although swap agreements are bilateral, the US has never drawn on a currency swap line."

    "text": "Focus shifts to countries with weaker reserves\nThe Fed’s deceleration of currency swaps prompted praise for the speed and scale of relief. But the facility left unresolved the plight of weaker, systemically less important currencies. Already burdened by higher interest rates on credit, countries without access to Fed swap lines saw a sharp uptick in the costs of accessing dollar funding markets, a Bank for International Settlements paper published in May found. Access to dollar funding has been exacerbated by capital outflows at rates higher than during the GFC.\nIn an attempt to provide reserves for dollar-strapped reserve banks, the Fed and ECB have each established repurchasing (repo) facilities for their currencies. The facilities work similarly to currency swap lines, providing short term liquidity and protecting against credit risk by dealing only with central banks. However, these repo facilities lie one step closer to secured loans, requiring foreign central banks to post collateral should they default on loan repurchasing. To protect against exchange rate risk, eligible collateral consists only of sovereign securities denominated in the lender’s currency. For example, the Fed’s Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) facility — detailed in a previous YPFS blogpost — accepts US Treasury securities of any maturity, while the ECB’s EUREP accepts euro-denominated debt from any of its constituent states as well as the central bank itself.\nThese repo agreements allow foreign central banks to avoid dumping large amounts of sovereign bonds into illiquid markets, ensuring value for both the Fed and the foreign bank in need. But the facilities can be more limited than the swap lines due to shorter maturities and higher interest rates. The FIMA’s repo facility only offers overnight maturities. Though such maturities can be rolled over, the repo agreements contrast sharply in this regard with the swap lines, which offer up to 84-day maturities.\nAdditionally, pricing is slightly steeper in FIMA and EUREP facilities. Where Fed central bank liquidity swaps add 25 basis points to the overnight index swap (OIS), FIMA adds 25 basis points to the Interest Rate on Excess Reserves (IOER). Currently the benchmark US overnight rate, the Federal Funds rate, stands at 0.05%, with the IOER at 0.10%. These prices potentially mean that liquidity will be cheaper for emerging markets than swap lines were for Singapore, which paid 1.09% for a March swap, but more expensive than recent swaps with the Fed’s standing accounts, which have carried rates around 0.33%.\nThe ECB has yet to announce pricing for its facility, which will run until June 2021, but Turkey has been mentioned as a potential applicant. Bloomberg reported that the nation had sought talks with the Group of 20 nations for its inclusion in bilateral swap agreements. For emerging markets, the International Monetary Fund has also been very active in approving emergency fund disbursement and stand-by facilities, and has introduced the new, “swap-like” Short-term Liquidity Line, and may be on track for support more given its still-large reserves."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Government-mandated shutdowns in response to the novel coronavirus have triggered delinquencies among commercial mortgages as businesses struggle with revenue. The purpose of this article is to characterize the risks to US commercial real estate posed by COVID-19 responses. Due to reporting incentives, data on mortgages packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) is more accessible and granular than data on the whole commercial mortgage market. Even though CMBS-associated properties constitute just 20% of outstanding multifamily and commercial debt, the data generated by such properties can indicate how the whole commercial real estate sector may be affected. On June 4, commercial real estate research firm Trepp reported its largest jump in delinquencies among mortgages involved in the $1.4 trillion CMBS market, with the rate spiking from 2.29% to 7.15%.\nThere is real stress on commercial landlords. But that stress sits narrowly within the commercial market. The same Trepp report disaggregated delinquencies, noting nearly 20% of lodging, and more than 10% of retail mortgages were delinquent in May. Less than 4% of multifamily, office, and industrial mortgages were delinquent over the same period. Despite historically high unemployment, government stimulus supports have perhaps helped sustain rental payments. Publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITs) invested in apartments collected at least 93% of rents in April, with most trusts collecting 95% or more. Meanwhile, offices continue to operate remotely, and warehousing has become more valuable as delivery services take on new importance.\n\nRetail shows signs of life\nThe speed at which consumers return to retail and lodging will factor importantly into the viability of mortgages in those sectors. The same data on publicly traded equity REITs reports rent collection figures for several owners of regional malls and shopping centers. Overall, between 50% and 65% of April rents were collected in shopping centers, while regional malls collected just 26% to 30% of rental payments.\nAs states re-open, rent payments may increase quite quickly. In Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas, as of June 2, retail foot traffic had already surged from its April nadir, but only to 38-52% of 2019 levels. Retail nationwide grew 17.7% in May, beginning to make up for sales contractions in March and April of 8.3% and 14.7% respectively. Further, the distribution of volume among types of businesses is unknown. The lockdowns have already caused the bankruptcy of JC Penney and Hertz, with AMC movie theaters currently being threatened. But stock data indicates that investors believe retail real estate has already bottomed out. After crashing in late February, prices of several large mall operators and REITs have stabilized and trended up.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nWarning in system(\"timedatectl\", intern = TRUE): running command 'timedatectl'\nhad status 1\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nread_csv(\"data/reit.csv\") %>%\n  group_by(symbol) %>%\n  mutate(adjusted = 100*adjusted/adjusted[date == min(date)]) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  ggplot(aes(date, adjusted)) +\n  geom_line(aes(col = symbol), show.legend = F) +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", color = \"#286dc0\", size = 1, geom = \"line\", show.legend = F) +\n  scale_color_grey() +\n  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 110), expand = c(0, 1)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Percent of Feb. 21 closing price\", title = \"Price change of NYSE-listed REITs since first confirmed case\", subtitle = \"Unweighted daily average in blue\", caption = \"Source: Yahoo Finance\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#00356b\", vjust = -1.67), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#00356b\", vjust = -1), plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#4a4a4a\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(color = \"#222222\"), axis.text = element_text(color = \"#4a4a4a\"), axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"#222222\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"#dddddd\"),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\nWarning: Removed 47 rows containing non-finite values (stat_summary).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 23 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market’s gradual recovery may have been informed by other indicators than the overall delinquency rate. Though 7.15% of securitized commercial mortgages were delinquent in May, 70% of those were only one month late. Trepp noted that a large number of mortgages remained in their 30-day grace period or actually reverted to current on their payments, though historically high delinquencies should still be expected.\nDespite these expectations of recovery, the woes for commercial real estate may have just begun. Financial Times pointed to June as a crucial test for businesses, since debt two months late often triggers serious penalties. Moreover, data collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis since 1991 show commercial delinquencies spiking as recessions end (Fig 2). Moreover, bond prices for CMBS exposed to lodging have tumbled. The same Financial Times article noted that BBB-rated tranches exposed to lodging shed approximately 40% of their value since early March. The asset specificity of hotels only lowers the value of real estate already faced with structural devaluation by services such as Airbnb.\n\n\nCode\ndelin <- fredr(series_id = \"DRCRELEXFACBS\") #retreive delinquency data using fredr\nrecessions <- read_csv(\"start, end\n1990-07-01, 1991-03-01\n2001-03-01, 2001-11-01\n2007-12-01, 2009-06-01\n2020-02-01, NA\") #add recessions from https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/fred/data/understanding-the-data/recession-bars/\n\n\nRows: 4 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndate (2): start, end\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrecessions[nrow(recessions), 2] <- Sys.Date() #update current recession with today's date\n\nggplot(delin) +\n  geom_line(aes(date, value), color = \"#286dc0\", show.legend = F) + #line plot of trade-weighted US dollar index\n  geom_rect(data = mutate(filter(recessions, end >= min(delin$date), start <= max(delin$date)), #only include recessions ending after start of series and beginning before end of series\n            start = if_else(start < min(delin$date), min(delin$date), start)), #trim start of overhanging recession\n            aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), #define sides of rectangle\n            fill = \"#978d85\", #Yale shading color\n            alpha = .33) + #opacity\n  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0), date_breaks = \"2 years\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Rate\", title = \"Commercial delinquency rate, 1991Q1 - 2019Q4\", subtitle = \"Shaded areas indicate recessions\", caption = \"Source: Federal Reserve Board of Governors\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#00356b\", vjust = -2), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#00356b\", vjust = -1), plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#4a4a4a\"), plot.margin = margin(r = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(color = \"#222222\"), axis.text = element_text(color = \"#4a4a4a\"), axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"#222222\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"#dddddd\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for commercial real estate must proceed carefully\nLandlords and owners are navigating treacherous waters should commercial tenants require serious rent assistance. While CMBS loans tend to be non-recourse, it is standard practice for loans to feature “bad boy” covenants designed to guard against principal-agent risk. Such covenants provide recourse in the event that borrowers commit actions that (in normal times) are irresponsible. Real estate attorneys point to two such actions in particular: significant rent renegotiation, and taking on senior indebtedness without investor consent.\nUS programs have thus far steered clear of these debt covenants, and offer viable channels should further support be authorized. The Payroll Protection Program (PPP), offering forgivable and unsecured loans to businesses, recently expanded the amount that could be used for non-payroll expenses to 40%, opening the door to rent support. Borrowing terms for the three programs under the Main Street Lending Program have also eased. The Priority and Extended lending facilities (MSPLF and MSELF, respectively) require loans to be secured, and prohibit subordination, but carve out exceptions for outstanding mortgage debts.\nGiven that these programs appear to avoid the dangers posed by “bad boy” covenants, it seems likely that strained borrowers are equipped with the resources to secure credit lifelines to at least prolong defaults for several more months. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would engage private CMBS markets in a more direct fashion. Thus far only two Fed actions support private CMBS. In March it included agency CMBS in its plan to make Open Market Desk purchases of $200 billion of MBS, and in April it expanded the eligible collateral for the Term-Asset Securities Lending Facility to include AAA tranches of CMBS. A previous YPFS article found that the Fed’s purchasing announcement had a positive effect on agency mortgage REITs (mREITs) while having only minimal effects on non-agency residential mortgage REITs.\nEquity REITs face different issues, principally those of eligibility and restrictions on usage. While property management companies are eligible for both PPP and MSLF loans, it is unclear as to whether equity REITs are eligible. They may violate the Small Business Administration’s rules making ineligible for loans “developers and landlords that” generally “do not actively use or occupy the assets acquired or improved with the loan proceeds.” However, equity REITs have applied for, and received PPP loans, potentially pushing this issue to the oversight bodies authorized by the CARES Act.\nAdditionally, the CARES Act prohibits the payment of dividends by corporations receiving support. While several programs have received blanket waivers from the Treasury Department, the Main Street Lending Facility has not. The legal structure of REITs requires the payment of dividends, and many REITs have opted to pay mostly in stock. REIT trade associations have already written to the Treasury Department requesting a waiver for this particular case, while the Internal Revenue Service has reprised rules adopted during the Global Financial Crisis, allowing REITs to hold (and therefore distribute) less cash.\nThe New York Times highlighted name-brand tenants–Gap, LVMH, Starbucks–that had stopped paying rent and started renegotiating leases. The article noted that “the strongest tenants — those most able to pay — are driving the hardest for a discount.” When renters know that the options for landlords are either lease renegotiation or a total loss of income, those with the ability to pay may augment the demands of those that cannot pay, further pressuring landlords.\nA Deloitte report noted that real estate development had flagged, with more than half of US construction firms surveyed halting projects. Social distancing rules precipitated decreased demand and disrupted construction sites. Commercial real estate’s sensitivity to economic downturns compounded the effects of decreased demand. The Deloitte report suggested that developers adapt rental properties to meet the needs of a changed society and strengthen resilience to future pandemics. The shock to brick-and-mortar businesses is likely to accelerate permanent transitions to online retail, work, and customer service across sectors. While several large companies have started these transitions, they will likely take several years to complete. Such a timeframe would flatten and spread the risks to commercial real estate finance.\nIn contrast, the greatest short-term risks posed by US commercial mortgages sit narrowly in lodging and retail, though high-turnover coworking spaces have already seen slashed revenues. CMBS-associated mortgages account for one fifth of outstanding commercial debt. While data are more widely and finely available for properties underlying CMBS loans, concerns similar to those discussed above exist with respect to non-securitized commercial mortgages. Where investors are exposed to lodging, prices have slumped, and questions abound regarding the sector’s long-term viability as nearly 20% of the CMBS-associated mortgages were reported delinquent in May. Retail activity is growing, but there is concern as to whether the recovery will be fast enough to stave off default in a sector with more than 10% of securitized mortgages in delinquency, which could hamper the real economy’s general pace of recovery."

In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography. —Suarez Miranda,Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658\n\nBut Baudrillard inverts Borges’ story. Rather than the residents abandoning the map, they will choose it, since the real world offers so many more imperfections to be disgusted at and dreams unfulfilled. After so many years, the map will win over the desert-bound kingdom. We will then be left with the “desert of the real”, a sort of wasteland of reality.

    "text": "Back to the main branch\nComing at this from a background in movies, however, I’m interested what impact CGI talent will have on the movie industry. It occurs to me that the actor-studio relations, which have been stable since United Artists was founded in 1919, may break apart again. Then, studios controlled actors through exclusive deals and were able to pressure talent in their off-screen lives to a greater extent than today. Avital quotes a marketing officer for an influencer management company to explain this makes so much business sense for studios:\n\nWhen you’re using regular influencers you have all the inherent risks of people living their lives; people can get DUI’s, get arrested, say non PC things. You’ll always have that risk. With CGI influencers you’ll have a markedly better chance of that not happening.\n\nThe richest studios will be able to purchase better CGI, better ranges of motion, etc, and each successful studio will succeed by insulating itself for years (decades?) with its own signature characters, the way Disney has with its animated stars. The studios will also be able to co-opt new politics quickly, to commodify the moment with ease.\nOf course human actors won’t be able to coexist. Taking Baudrillard seriously, we should expect the current desire for authenticity to wear off at some point as viewers accept and expect computers to do the talking as they do the exploding now. One upshot is that the incredibly beautiful star may fade (though its place will be taken by even less credible pixels) and famous human talent, to the extent it still resides in one person, will be a rangy voice or—if motion capture remains viable against pure illustration—an emotive face. Even though it is not linear, specialization happens whenever new technologies are adopted:\n\nthe introduction of cinema made obsolete the need for thousands of local theater actors who could deliver lines\nwhen sound was added, actors again had to deliver lines, but only once\nthe decline of the musical has meant that the best actors need never dance; and [ultra-]HD emphasized skin quality [and makeup departments].\n\nIt might take a while, but Hollywood will look even more like Broadway in its reduced size and lower pay as improved CGI routinizes talent. Studios will be the big winners here. But which studios? My money’s on Disney and Dreamworks (Universal), which used terrible 2019 versions of The Lion King and Cats to test the limits of believability, but no other movie houses possess the CGI chops.\nThere are quite a few gaming companies that do, however. This would be a textbook version of a sector undervalued by establishment media (if not by Wall Street) swallowing a legacy media company whole. Besides, they have practice. In the gaming landscape, studios have always been dominant. They’ve already resolved muddled through the ethics of fake people doing fake actions in front of real audiences. As more and more media companies jump into VR and Oculus gains traction, there’s an opportunity for reconvergence between games and film."

    "text": "Marathons are a fucking business. The City of Richmond anaesthetized its downtown and a good chunk of its of the scenery for this event. Unimaginably, the $100 entry fees are well-priced (at least for the marathon). Every mile brought, alternately, water, powerade, and port-a-johns or a live band. The entire day preceding was filled with events and vendors at Richmond’s convention center. In addition to the requisite race shirt, medal, and very necessary blanket, the finish line included yoga sessions, beer on tap, and pizza, all included. Meeting this massive coordination of resources were runners—truly of all types—swaddled in air-wicking this and energy-conserving that. They came and came, some twenty odd thousand, the majority towing families, friends, and track clubs. As a lone runner with 4 year-old shoes, all this baggage was so apparent. And sometimes this baggage wanted to make itself known, with a glimmering wristwatch or suspension systems for their extraneous gear. At day’s end, however, there are no shortcuts through 26.2 miles. Your $250 Vaporfly’s are no match for my ragged Kinvara 5’s if my breath is measured and stride high.\nMy stride, however, was not high. This was absolutely an ordeal, if not quite of epic proportions. Due mostly to the hard shock of tarmac and my injury-diminished mileage these last few weeks, my calves began to make their presence felt about 4 miles in, which was about 10 miles earlier than I had hoped. Still, Richmond’s gentle terrain kept my pretty good until mile 16, when:\n\n\nWind made forward progress suddenly a thing to think about, instead of do\nMy dinner finally caught up with me Fighting these knocked me out of a stride I had found for the first time around the half-marathon mark. I made it through the next ten miles because of the runners showing me left and right how to fight, and the outstanding spectators. During my training, I probably saw a total of 200 people, most of which were at a single park in Charlottesville. Here I could not run 100 meters without a banana, a high-five, or a swig of Miller Lite. At mile 21, I heard the first call for BEER, and double taked, able to snake across the road to the last volunteer. That helped.\n\n\nThis was as much a marathon as it was a real estate tour. I had always drove through Monument Ave. and thought it quaint in comparison to New Orleans’ St. Charles St. It turns out that is not where Richmond’s wealthy live. Continue on Monument, crossing over the freeway built to punish Black neighborhoods for school integration, and you’ll enter Henrico County. There Riverview Dr. follows lazily the James, and hundred-acre estates dominate both City and County waterfronts."

    "text": "For literal centuries, publications have solved this problem with style guides and time-consuming editing practices. However, these are only as strong as their enforcement. Without savvy, patient editors and authors with hours to spare, editing for standardization rightfully takes a back seat to editing for clarity and content. A somewhat newer solution involves distributing Word templates that authors simply fill in, Mad-Libs style. But again, you run into the problem of enforcement. The first time a line breaks where you don’t want it to, or you copy the source style along with the text, the Word template ceases to be authoritative.\nMoreover, for editors reviewing work years later, if citations aren’t perfect or comprehensive, finding the original document can be a bear. These systems do not link the product to the process. They allow authors to keep “two sets of books”: one, incomplete but well-formatted, that gets published; another, complete but unstructured, located somewhere without a link tracing to it. In this way, Word documents—for all the ways they liberate formatting and track changes—are little different from plain paper. We have had ways to connect product and process for years, but it is hard to generate buy-in. Some compromise between accessibility (plain-text editors aren’t familiar to most) and utility (e.g. Markdown would be ideal) is usually required.\nOur compromise is the amazing reference manager Zotero. It builds citations using Citation Style Language (CSL). CSL imposes it style in Word documents using fields (kinda like those used often for page numbers or automatically updating dates) that it controls. In this way it is authoritative. Zotero feeds it information stored in its desktop app. What you put in is put out on the page. In this way it connects product to process: to create a correct and nice-looking bibliography requires citing throughout a document and inputting data correctly to Zotero, which is super easy to search and connects documents to their contexts on the web.\nCSL, is also open source, which means that we could configure a style to our liking. While we mostly like Chicago (author-date) style, I and another Research Associate updated it with some contextual information. I learnt this XML-like language and have been deploying it with Git. It’s my first experience developing software that people actually use. This makes a huge difference! Working with something that will be used in the future by end-users made me think several steps ahead to maintain forward- and backward-compatibility, and reminded me how much I enjoy solving problems.\nCheck out the code here."

    "text": "A few weeks ago, I started reading first-person, career advice/journey blogs. I had stumbled on the first one, fifty coffees, while researching personal branding, thinking I needed to work more to stand out from a crowded field of applicants with more data-science credentials than I had. Luckily, Kin + Carta/Cascade Data Labs took a chance on me, and I’m thrilled to start as a Data Analyst there in May, thus mooting any urgent need for personal branding. But, that first blog, and many after, have rekindled interests I had long forgotten or shunned.\nfifty coffees has so much to be jaded about. The font—basic—the theme—HGTV rustic—the heading MUSINGS—gag—and the quotes—well, just read McConnaughey’s Greenlights and you’ll develop a Pavlovian eyeroll for that font. But, boy was I being dismissive. Worse, all these associations spelled out something a little misogynistic.1 Her words were concise2—and I could feel her excitement bubbling through the screen. Each of her coffees built on the last and, after 11 coffees, she can spin webs of connections between life stories and lesson’s she learned.\nI took from fifty coffees a sense that ambition and direction would be really useful and lead to something great. From her blog, I jumped to Morgen Newman, who wrote a blog about starting a successful spicy honey business in 30 days (and kept it up for much longer). This was a bit like watching Masterclass: I had no sense that I myself had the resources or partners to do what they did, but I did realize that I could get there. It was an infectious read because it forced me to understand just how much I could get done in a month and demonstrated the ol’ work-smarter-not-harder truism. It also left me with a roadmap of how to start a company, something I’ve been yearning for more recently after consuming: * The Dropout * this twitter thread * some Marc Andreessen essays\nAgain, these are all people that I would (should?) chafe at. It’s a bunch of ego-feeding. It’s people who use buzzwords because they don’t have anything to say. It’s people who got fabulously rich because they got in at the ground floor, but who also don’t know anything about the world outside their own building.\nBut, what separates these blogs from others is that they ring of experience. It’s not a Digital Content Editor, it’s someone who did the thing! And it’s a view into how they answer questions that I, a career changer person, have been having, as well as questions that I haven’t known enough to ask yet. A little of it has been vicarious decisionmaking; that’s when I don’t want to decide a big, life-changing thing or feel like I’ve already passed the opportunity to do so, and get my fix by watching others do it. And, a little of it has been prestige porn: these people have started organizations that have changed the existenz of people’s lives; it’s like the eyebrow-raising parts of a biography, all in 800 words and all written in a How-To tone.\nThe How-To tone does help, though. It helps mentally understand the stakes and that what happens today sets up a foundation for tomorrow (that one’s from The Defining Decade). I feel like I’m growing more by reading these, like it’s a shortcut to experiencing. And all this helps me engage in the process as opposed to the destination, which I’ve been obsessed with since at least PST. From The Rock Warrior’s Way, I’ve remembered that enjoying the process is the important part and is what will feel most fulfilling at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis is something I need to unpack because I think of myself as being very open to women as supervisors, confidants, and intellects. I think it’s bound up in the aesthetics of academia and, ultimately, class.↩︎\ntagline: fifty coffees to find my next thing↩︎"

    "text": "Overview\nThe United States Federal Register is the clearing house for every revision to US administrative law, regulatory enforcement, and the more stupid forms of jockeying and horn-tooting by federal agencies. The website, charged with the supremely bureaucratic duty of pigeonholing and circumscribing every sort of change in the law, is quite beautiful. Its ease, features, and appearance bear the marks of something that is truly for the public.\nTo aid readers, [and the odd corporation trying to stay a step ahead of environmental regulations,] the Office of the Federal Register got a leg up from a developer who made an API client for R. Unfortunately,1 that client has been rendered useless by updates. In the name of openness digital and governmental, I set to work on a new API client that would:\n\nwork\nteach me the fundamentals of APIs\ndisplay some clever solutions"

    "text": "Imagine a Beaux Arts mashup of The Great Dictator and Life is Beautiful set inside a Moonrise Kingdom prequel. Can’t? Taika Waititi has. Jojo Rabbit finds a small, timid Hitler Youth (the Moonrise Kingdom bit) named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) in a world much too big for him. Waititi brings the fanaticism and anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany into close quarters by portraying Jojo’s imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler. His portrayal is an incredible use of dramatic irony: we see the craziness of Hitler’s cult of personality and ideology, while the ten year-old sees his idol. Same as any sports star, Jojo’s room is decked out in memorabilia and posters to the Führer’s power.\nWaititi The Actor mirrors Chaplin by lampooning Hitler’s decisions and imitating his manner of speech. All the silliness you’d expect from a ten year-old is there, along with biting jokes for those geopolitically inclined. On a different level, Waititi The Director channels Life is Beautiful by showing us a world three feet high instead of six. Jojo Rabbit is a coming-of-age tale, with adults tugging at the strings of his life behind some curtain of maturity. These adults are sometimes imbeciles (low-level Nazi soldiers), sometimes courageous (Jojo’s mother [Scarlett Johannson]), and sometimes both depending on the situation (washed up Captain Klenzendorf [Sam Rockwell]). They operate formally in the adult realm, which inexorably approaches and darkens Jojo’s world throughout the film, but Waititi The Screenwriter manages to find great laughs in the childlike tendencies of even the Gestapo. This is not to say that the director makes fun of the culture of fear or terrible tragedy that infected Nazi Germany. He finds laughs in both dark and lighter moments by exposing the ridiculousness of Nazism.\nLet me say this again: Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, sharing atmosphere with The Grand Budapest Hotel. And it is because of this childlike urgency and earnestness that the emotional content impresses so thoroughly. It is every bit as solemn as Budapest’s gravest moments, without the reverence. The Gestapo comes, as it always does, for Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), a friend of Jojo’s dead sister living in her room. McKenzie packs emotion to spare. With tenuous power over Jojo as his physical and intellectual superior, she delivers stinging rebukes of Jojo’s indoctrination, while ultimately boxing herself up in his attic. This confinement heightens every interaction with her, and allows her to speak beyond her situation for people in hiding everywhere. Jojo Rabbit navigates conflicting ideas of right and wrong, exploiting the disagreements to heartbreaking, funny, or joyous ends."

    "text": "So, it’s a bit weird that I’m now investing time in creating personal branding. I had intended that this time would give me a leg up on other applicants, but now I realize that it let’s me scratch an itch I forgot I had. Plus, with the new job, I feel that I can be a bit more adventurous in design—the acute pain of rejection had whittled my design instincts into conservativity.\nI started (as I seem to always do now) by writing a procurement contract for myself. The personal branding must:\n\nbe distinctive (if not unique)\nunify, at the very least, a résumé, a cover letter, and a business card\nuse open-source tech\nplay nice with the automated realities of networking/applying today\ndemonstrate and develop my skills\nleave open the possibility of adding other document types\nease portability between PDFs, this website, LinkedIn, and GitHub\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t look too closely at the possibility of this last requirement; LinkedIn doesn’t seem to allow people to edit their own info via API. This fact is particularly disappointing since Microsoft owns LinkedIn and has stated it’s open-source intentions. But, que sera sera. To fulfill the rest of my requirements, I turned to TeX. I currently use TeX for all my résumés and cover letters, but I decided my new template could afford to be more daring than Trey Hunner’s classic template. And, it would have to be more distinctive than Deb Das’ ubiquitous CV.\nBut, only a little bit. The new template is just two steps removed from Das’ CV, the first being Shubham Mazmuder’s PlushCV, and the second being some lines injected from Andy Bernard’s non-repoducible example.2 An important, practical change was the substitution of ligatures and other glyphs for unicode symbols. Applicant-tracking systems struggle with LaTeX documents because of these features, though it pains me to remove them. I’m also keeping the same fonts throughout, a habit from my own yearbook days that is compatible with the minimalist, quiver-of-one idealism that I’m bringing to this whole endeavor. Naturally, the fonts must be open-source, so I’m using Adobe’s Source Sans Pro and Source Code Pro.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource typeforms\n\n\n\nDeveloping the résumé was easy enough, given how little I changed things:\n\n\n\nMy new résumé\n\n\nThe cover letter was easy too; just remove the sections, add a signature, and, voilá!\n\n\n\nSample cover letter\n\n\nThe business card? A little more involved. I found a fantastic introduction to business cards in LaTeX, with a great little bit about designing a QR code linked to my own vCard (something that can be scanned easily if you keep such things in a transparent phone case)s. Initials add a bit of class to the whole affair, and doesn’t carry a lot of consequences given how seldom they are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness card front\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness card back\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, to make these even easier to edit, I created global options used across the media. This allows users to change fonts, colors, and contact information without doing so for each document.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI’ve been watching Julia↩︎\nYou’ll notice that I’ve mentioned the names here, and that’s because they’re stuck in my head! When you make a résumé template, you enjoy the benefit of other’s learning all about you.↩︎\nYou may have noticed I’ve changed this blog’s typeface from IBM Plex to Source; I’ve learned from this process that IBM Plex is a bit too IBM-er for me.↩︎"
