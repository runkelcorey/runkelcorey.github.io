&lt;p&gt;My friend Avital wrote a great essay last year about an Instagram influencer.
The publication she released it has, unfortunately, flopped, but I will give the gist.
Lil Miquela&amp;rsquo;s 2.9 million followers pale in comparison to the platform&amp;rsquo;s biggest stars, but she has something they do not: an endless future.
Her computer-generated skin will never age, her fun setting will never be burdened by kids or sickness or hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay asks why, among the Zoomer clamor for authenticity, so many follow Lil Miquela&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;doings&amp;rdquo;.
Avital makes the obligatory genuflections toward the fact that nobody is doing real things on Instagram before digging into this issue that makes so quaint the normal Social Media is Artifice problem.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:The-point-of-thi&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:The-point-of-thi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unnecessary-fork-that-may-interest-those-who-have-not-read-jean-baudrillard&#34;&gt;Unnecessary fork that may interest those who have not read Jean Baudrillard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She takes Jean Baudrillard as her starting point, skip down two paragraphs to , Baudrillard who &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in reference to Jorge Luis Borges&amp;rsquo; one-paragraph short story, &amp;ldquo;On Exactitude in Science&amp;rdquo;, translated by Andrew Hurley:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;In that  Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province.
In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it.
The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters.
In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that  Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
—Suarez Miranda,Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Baudrillard inverts Borges&amp;rsquo; story.
Rather than the residents abandoning the map, they will choose it, since the real world offers so many more imperfections to be disgusted at and dreams unfulfilled.
After so many years, the map will win over the desert-bound kingdom.
We will then be left with the &amp;ldquo;desert of the real&amp;rdquo;, a sort of wasteland of reality.
Instead, everything is thrown to the economically productive artifice, which in this case is Lil Miquela and her cast of computer-generated characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-main-branch&#34;&gt;Back to the main branch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming at this from a background in movies, however, I&amp;rsquo;m interested what impact CGI talent will have on the movie industry.
It occurs to me that the actor-studio relations, which have been stable since United Artists was founded in 1919, may break apart again.
Then, studios controlled actors through exclusive deals and were able to pressure talent in their off-screen lives to a greater extent than today.
Avital quotes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/head/article/41436/1/mixed-race-identity-cgi-influencers-lil-miquela&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a marketing officer for an influencer management company&lt;/a&gt; to explain this makes so much business sense for studios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re using regular influencers you have all the inherent risks of people living their lives; people can get DUI&amp;rsquo;s, get arrested, say non PC things. You&amp;rsquo;ll always have that risk. With CGI influencers you&amp;rsquo;ll have a markedly better chance of that not happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The richest studios will be able to purchase better CGI, better ranges of motion, etc, and each successful studio will succeed by insulating itself for years (decades?) with its own signature characters, the way Disney has with its animated stars.
The studios will also be able to co-opt new politics quickly, to commodify the moment with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course human actors won&amp;rsquo;t be able to coexist.
Taking Baudrillard seriously, we should expect the current desire for authenticity to wear off at some point as viewers accept and expect computers to do the talking as they do the exploding now.
One upshot is that the incredibly beautiful star may fade (though its place will be taken by even less credible pixels) and famous human talent, to the extent it still resides in one person, will be a rangy voice or&amp;mdash;if motion capture remains viable against pure illustration&amp;mdash;an emotive face.
Even though it is not linear, specialization happens whenever new technologies are adopted:
1. the introduction of cinema made obsolete the need for thousands of local theater actors who could deliver lines
2. when sound was added, actors again had to deliver lines, but only once
3. the decline of the musical has meant that the best actors need never dance; and [ultra-]HD &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.today.com/popculture/hd-unforgiving-actors-makeup-artists-wbna24581670&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;emphasized&lt;/a&gt; skin quality [and makeup departments].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might take a while, but Hollywood will look even more like Broadway in its reduced size and lower pay as improved CGI routinizes talent.
Studios will be the big winners here.
But which studios?
My money&amp;rsquo;s on Disney and Dreamworks (Universal), which used terrible 2019 versions of The Lion King and Cats to test the limits of believability, but no other movie houses possess the CGI chops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few gaming companies that do, however.
This would be a textbook version of a sector undervalued by establishment media (if not by Wall Street) swallowing a legacy media company whole. Besides, they have practice.
In the gaming landscape, studios have always been dominant. They&amp;rsquo;ve already resolved muddled through the ethics of fake people doing fake actions in front of real audiences.
As more and more media companies jump into VR and Oculus gains traction, there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for reconvergence between games and film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:The-point-of-thi&#34;&gt;The point of this piece is not to challenge Baudrillard. Even though we acknowledge and have learned from his book, that does not mean we can effectively combat it. His ephigraph, from Ecclesiastes, still rings true: &amp;ldquo;The simulacrum [that Lil Miquela is the faker] is never that which conceals the truth [that human Instagrammers are real]&amp;mdash;it is the truth which conceals that there is none [both are fake]. The simulacrum is true.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:The-point-of-thi&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Aspirational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/07/aspirational-efficiency/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to derail any work that I am doing is by linking to an article ranking and comparing things that will help me live a better life. That article might rank the 10 best productivity apps, it may uncover new services which partition and categorize every second of my day, or&amp;mdash;as it did yesterday&amp;mdash;it could offer me a phone that can satisfy my needs immediately, stripping my day of wasted time. The only certainty is that I, in my manifold time management skills, will click on that link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a phenomenon entirely local to myself until I saw this &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/essays/how-did-being-happy-become-a-matter-of-relentless-competitive-work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from Aeon, noting that life management has become a juggernaut in consumer retail, with &amp;ldquo;self-care and anti-stress products now rounding out the bestseller list on Amazon&amp;rdquo;. We&amp;rsquo;ve reined in other animals, organizations of people, and our bodies by calibrating each measurable parameter, so why not do the same for our minds? Unfortunately, we don&amp;rsquo;t seem quite as pliant as the optimization equations imply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic, made inexorable by limitless access to information, tugs at our happiness. Behind whatever tool or activity or person present before us lurks an alternative, a next-best option. This idea has driven every rationalist attempt at decision making, but its actual calculus has changed considerably since the 1990s. Before then, catalogued libraries and television delivered then-unprecedented access to information. The task of research had become immediately more accessible, but also less clear. Suddenly, more and more causes sprang up to explain each effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move from card catalogues and TV to Wikipedia and on-demand streaming was a leap in this dimension. Different from past moves was the sheer scale of new information. The closest comparison to make would likely be the telegram that could relay news around the world in minutes, but that did not solve the last-mile problem that our phones and computers did. Similar to past moves is the growing illusion of choice. Most definitions model illusory choice as a free decision between a constrained set of options, like choosing from a soda machine that offers a dozen brands but where every choice is a Coca-Cola product. But rather than onstrained options, I interpret illusory choice as constrained decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brain budgets time and resources based on prior neurological sequences, updating expectations with each iteration. While we may understand how normal it is not to find an exhaustive cost-benefits comparison of the more than 2,000 results for &amp;ldquo;thimble&amp;rdquo; on Amazon, our brains may not. Our expectations have been conditioned by the norms of evidence-based administration to treat anything less than exhaustive comparisons as failure. This extends to our lives, where exhaustive comparison has meant nothing less than exhaustion. Where once, exhaustive comparisons meant eyeballing dozens, now it means eyeballing hundreds, thousands, or millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our internal search processes can&amp;rsquo;t handle such scale. While they have gradually widened, the velocity of extension by the market has effectively capped the rate at which we had to develop non-exhaustive ways to search. When the village had a single cobbler, shoes were a constant, not a variable to optimize over. Still, when there are ten types of black beans at the grocery store, they can be compared quite readily. But when it&amp;rsquo;s always possible to opt for peer-to-peer sellers in Kolkata over the ~local~ Walmart, people are given the room every day to exhaust their critical thinking skills trying to gauge the expected payoffs of a hundred options, and a million more they know to be lurking, accessible to anyone with the right search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our minds haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up yet. They can take on waves of epic proportions, but a tide that lifts them high enough to see the world&amp;rsquo;s ginormity will overwhelm. I see two ways out: time and pragmatism. The first just says that after enough time passes, our minds will adjust, will think in different ways to approach this different problem. But that option offers only consolation to people currently. Option two offers that different way. Construct in your mind a noble lie, something appealing but fanciful. Then, believe in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adhering to a set of values fixes those variables as constants. This is Marie Kondo for your mind, with the tiny caveat that beliefs weigh far more than shower organizers, dressers, or homes. The values chosen don&amp;rsquo;t have to conform to Marie Kondo&amp;ndash;like advice. In fact, choosing something already at tension with what FastCompany promises are the best ways to increase productivity is probably best. It&amp;rsquo;s good training for the future. Rather, pick values that will let you do the most of your wants, your in-the-moment pleasures. Do not conflate &amp;lsquo;do the most&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;most choices&amp;rsquo;. To do the most, you need clear boundaries that, if crossed, bind you to decisions, decisions that you could theoretically even come to regret, but decisions that you need to make. Pragmatism means believing what needs to be believed, even if it can&amp;rsquo;t stand up to rationalist inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
