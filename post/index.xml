      <title>Putting Theory in its Place</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2020/01/20/putting-theory-in-its-place/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When statistics disagree with words, theory can be an effective arbitrator. These disciplinary stories impose an otherwordly coherence on an incoherent world. With so much information at hand, I became addicted to theory for this very quality. The few bad habits I struggle to kick have (thankfully) instilled a probably irrational fear of new bad habits. Unfortunately, in kicking these habits and warding off others, I turned to theory to make my decisions. In doing so, I appealed to ever more abstract and cloudy narratives to buttress those closer to the ground (for theory can only be invalidated by other theories). And so, my first two years of undergrad were marked by a myopic embrace that left me pretentious and ill-suited to conditions on the ground floor of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letting go of theory as the source of knowledge has been such a difficult process for me because of issues I have trusting others&amp;mdash;I compulsively check my girlfriend in areas where she by so many miles has the upper hand of practical and, yes, theoretical experience. By listening to an argument, I myself pass judgment on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://writing.upenn.edu/~taransky/Barthes.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;death of its author&lt;/a&gt;. While I enjoy this ultimate power, it cannot explain why I return to theory when all else fails&amp;mdash;indeed, it is a famed theorist&amp;rsquo;s failure that prompts one of my swift judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s on the continued survival of authors after meeting my scrutiny that I base my returns. The reasons for these positive judgments are no doubt varied and incoherent to some, but I am sure that many follow a similar pattern. First, a writer will introduce familiar concept in unfamiliar language. Then, this language&amp;mdash;combined with elongated sentences&amp;mdash;renders said once-familiar concept gobbledygook. At this point, my capacity for calling BS on difficult works is hindered by my choice to read almost exclusively ~the classics~. This choice, and the knowledge of this choice, activates a psychological muscle in me that translates prestige as authority. When aggregated, this muscle operates as a sociological pressure. Seen below, the Tennis Court Oath makes abundantly clear in whom authority rests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jacques-Louis David&#39;s *Tennis Court Oath* uses attention to show where power lies. &#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all vindicates Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s quote &amp;ldquo;I am not understood. Hence my authority.&amp;rdquo; This logic does not bode well for readers, however. Blinded by high-wattage prestige, one loses with the ability to criticize the ability to think. The authority that difficult, highly-regarded theory held over me also held me in its sway: I assumed that there was something essential to living life to be plumbed in theory, rather than a story told using the dictionary of a particular discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I have maintained a weaning off of theory by, ironically, reading more theory. Richard Rorty refreshed pragmatism for a theory-weary America&amp;mdash;not by assuring us that what works in practice works regardless of the theory, but by stabbing epistemology in the back with what can best be termed an analytic deconstruction. Understanding his work proved to be a crucial step in unlearning much of what school had taught me, but elsewhere in my life, I clung to theory, thinking that the less-rigorous exercise, wellness, and movie literature could still be optimized by a turn towards theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found were concrete ways in which that thought&amp;mdash;that life could be optimized by theory&amp;mdash;disappointed me. This disappointment brought the set of things I Know to Be True up with the set of things I &lt;em&gt;Think&lt;/em&gt; I Know to Be True. In other words, what I had read was made real before my eyes, elevating that knowledge to second-nature status. The vehicle for this realization was cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had begun really trying to cook two years ago, when I spurned the atrocities of my university&amp;rsquo;s dining hall. I asked for an Instant Pot that Christmas, and found hundreds of recipes to choose from. What the recipes called for, I did diligently. My girlfriend rarely challenged these steps, for the Instant Pot admits no air to its chamber, let alone the senses that allow facilitate good cooking. Recently, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from the Instant Pot in pursuit of perfectly-tuned seasoning and picturesque browning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, the superior wisdom of the cooks around me&amp;mdash;my girlfriend most loudly&amp;mdash;has battered the recipes I originally held so high. Trusting my own senses, and thinking critically about each step, have been given a newfound priority. The genius of cooking is that the tongue is already a great judge of cooking! In this light, it is immediately clear that famous names and convoluted explanations offer nowhere near the precision and attention that the mouth serves up instantaneously. &amp;ldquo;To write is to reach&amp;rdquo; said Barthes, and to cook might as well be added to that list. Each attempt is a venture into unknown territory, where local knowledge trumps the views from nowhere offered by orphaned recipes on cooking websites. Samin Nosrat&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat&lt;/em&gt; grounds this truth with a million stories of direction-following as well as rule-breaking. The book explicitly claims to induct the laws of good cooking, but, implicitly, it works because of her history in kitchens around the world. She resists listicle format, step-by-step instructions in favor of narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision allows for reflection and judgment, and she constantly refers back to cooks&amp;rsquo; own palettes, finger tips, and eardrums. This reference (and deference) does the real work of teaching, imploring readers to become writers and eaters to become cooks. Trying to assimilate her principles with her recipes has already improved my cooking, and the fearlessness with which I annotate her beautifully-illustrated hardback has been a quietly-empowering experience. Cooking has shown me what my great professor Marlon Ross once told me, that great work speaks up to theory instead of letting theory talk down to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>*Just Mercy* – a Legal Drama Adaptation That Fails to Do Justice to a Compelling Memoir</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/12/25/just-mercy-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/12/25/just-mercy-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 1/20/2020: check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/just-mercy-a-legal-drama-adaptation-that-fails-to-do-justice-to-a-compelling-memoir/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Just Mercy*’s most powerful scenes concern three different people condemned to death, all legally represented by Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan). These scenes punctuate the film, as we witness Stevenson’s growth from timid law student to successful advocate for those on death row. The strengths of *Just Mercy*—the eponymous memoir by Stevenson—lie in its plot and the range of lives contained within. But while the movie safely navigates the politics of portraying incarceration and gross injustice, it runs aground by bashing its viewership over the head by over-telling a story well shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see, first, the timid intern some 800-miles south of Harvard to meet a man his own age on death row. We see, then, the execution of Herb Richardson, a veteran who developed PTSD during Vietnam and proceeded to detonate a bomb on a lover’s porch. Finally, we see Walter McMillan (Jamie Foxx) run the gauntlet of police and legal implements to win freedom for a crime he did not commit, that canonic Southern Sin of murdering a white woman whilst Black. This story dominates &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt;, and exposes features of the legal system in Monroeville, AL (the literary and extra-literary site of &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;) that the average viewer would not believe existed in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan cracks the ‘rational’ suspicions of the first two inmates, seeming both cool-headed and eager. He is at his best showing off these gifts, gifts the real Bryan Stevenson possesses, of blind understanding and unflappability. The stories of these men evoke grief and frustration without the aid of embellishment, and Just Mercy refrains admirably in their cases. And it is mostly free from fetish, a necessity that prisoner-centric films still neglect. With Walter McMillan, however, Jordan plays somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Walter McMillan, Stephenson transforms into the Atticus Finch archetype he jokes about. I had hoped for a courtroom monologue-free drama—true to life—but &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; just could not resist. Part of this discrepancy is a defect of the book-film transubstantiation: the book budgets roughly 10% of its pages to legal history and explaining the appeal process for Alabama death row inmates. Instead of devising some snappy montage (à la Michael Lewis film adaptations) explaining Alabama’s criminal processing and social statics showcasing racial disparities, &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt;, the movie, uses Jordan and legal assistant Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) as mouthpieces. What results are dialogues where both characters tell the other what they clearly already know. &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; has not caught the trend of making its viewers think, spoon-feeding plot and context at its own expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Jordan says what doesn’t need to be said. When he visits McMillan’s family, extended family, and neighbors, it’s clear that Bryan Stevenson cares, that he goes beyond to help this man and his family, that he does not indict the men he sees (legally or illegally) on death row. Jordan uses his tremendously expressive face—clenched jaws and furrowed brows, or his 500-watt smile—to summon indignation or pleasure. He could very well have been the right actor for this movie, but his script sounds trite, due to his own delivery and adjustments, or to an overzealous writer/producer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think much of *Just Mercy*’s shortcomings fall on director Destin Daniel Cretton, though surely the suits at Warner Bros. pushed the platitudes whenever possible. I do not mind adaptations heightening the drama of a book, but they must pass a few criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major plot events represented faithfully: Here, the movie receives close to full marks. The first meeting on death row, execution, and first trial are close to perfect, but the release of Walter McMillan sees Stevenson lecturing the courtroom before judgment is passed. This is stupid as well as melodramatic; part of the book’s brilliance is its emphasis on how pedestrian structural racism and indigent defense is in the legal system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding to this mis-adaption is the portrayal of Monroeville’s prosecutor. Prosecutors have jobs, they have staffs, and they have electorates. These facts make their jobs less about justice than legal statistics and relationships with the police department. In the final 16 minutes, the prosecutor somehow turns from the patronizing careerist of the first two hours to sheepish moral man in full realization of his mistake. In reality, the state’s case was untenable. There was no uplifting realization by the white prosecutor that justice had not been served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The adapted work’s environment communicated: This component is *Just Mercy*’s worst. The book leadens Stevenson’s journey with the twin histories of criminal prosecution and racism in America. As I mentioned before, the book resorts to chunky dialogue to explain basic facts of prosecution, but with no reference to the wider scope of these facts, no sense that these convictions happen in every jurisdiction in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embellishments add to the message: I’m of two minds here. Jordan’s sermonizing belies Stevenson’s cool-headed determination. He was not Thurgood Marshall in the courtroom. But the adjustments to Walter McMillan’s incarceration were, at times, nice substitutes. Never in the book does Walter engage in a single aggressive or even energetic act. Here we see him thrashing against the human restraints that envelop him. The sense of rage, devoid in the book, is understandable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; turns a book powerful for its facticality into something expected and over-determined. No one who reads the facts of this case would have the need to decipher, yet the all-too-familiar scenes of excessive force and righteousness of Michael B. Jordan as Bryan Stevenson are so obviously coded as to rob any viewers of their right to interpretation. The movie wins when getting out of its own way, offering the un-cinematic particularities (a scratchy record full of dread just before the electric chair) and plain humanity (Stevenson joking with his first client, about what he won’t say) of, you know, real humans. It is a poignant story of what it means for anyone with a modicum of power to remember the wrongs that have already happened instead of trying to inscribe their own story ignorant of what has come before. But check out the book instead from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1119116448&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;your local library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jojo Rabbit Explores Universal Notions of Morality through a Childlike Perspective</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/30/jojo-rabbit-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/30/jojo-rabbit-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 11/30/2019: check &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/jojo-rabbit-explores-universal-notions-of-morality-through-a-childlike-perspective/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; out at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a Beaux Arts mashup of &lt;em&gt;The Great Dictator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; set inside a &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; prequel. Can’t? Taika Waititi has. &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; finds a small, timid Hitler Youth (the &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; bit) named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) in a world much too big for him. Waititi brings the fanaticism and anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany into close quarters by portraying Jojo’s imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler. His portrayal is an incredible use of dramatic irony: we see the craziness of Hitler’s cult of personality and ideology, while the ten year-old sees his idol. Same as any sports star, Jojo’s room is decked out in memorabilia and posters to the Führer’s power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waititi The Actor mirrors Chaplin by lampooning Hitler’s decisions and imitating his manner of speech. All the silliness you’d expect from a ten year-old is there, along with biting jokes for those geopolitically inclined. On a different level, Waititi The Director channels &lt;em&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; by showing us a world three feet high instead of six. Jojo Rabbit is a coming-of-age tale, with adults tugging at the strings of his life behind some curtain of maturity. These adults are sometimes imbeciles (low-level Nazi soldiers), sometimes courageous (Jojo’s mother [Scarlett Johannson]), and sometimes both depending on the situation (washed up Captain Klenzendorf [Sam Rockwell]). They operate formally in the adult realm, which inexorably approaches and darkens Jojo’s world throughout the film, but Waititi The Screenwriter manages to find great laughs in the childlike tendencies of even the Gestapo. This is not to say that the director makes fun of the culture of fear or terrible tragedy that infected Nazi Germany. He finds laughs in both dark and lighter moments by exposing the ridiculousness of Nazism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say this again: Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, sharing atmosphere with &lt;em&gt;The Grand Budapest Hotel&lt;/em&gt;. And it is because of this childlike urgency and earnestness that the emotional content impresses so thoroughly. It is every bit as solemn as *Budapest*’s gravest moments, without the reverence. The Gestapo comes, as it always does, for Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), a friend of Jojo’s dead sister living in her room. McKenzie packs emotion to spare. With tenuous power over Jojo as his physical and intellectual superior, she delivers stinging rebukes of Jojo’s indoctrination, while ultimately boxing herself up in his attic. This confinement heightens every interaction with her, and allows her to speak beyond her situation for people in hiding everywhere. Jojo Rabbit navigates conflicting ideas of right and wrong, exploiting the disagreements to heartbreaking, funny, or joyous ends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>American Heartbreak</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/21/american-heartbreak/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the American heartbreak–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rock on which Freedom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stumped its toe–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great mistake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Jamestown made&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;— Langston Hughes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I try to recall this poem, I search for &amp;ldquo;Plymouth Rock poem&amp;rdquo;, and freak out beacuse I can&amp;rsquo;t find it for a few seconds. This is because, all along, Hughes alludes to the founding of our nation without ever saying so. He points to our founding virtue, Freedom, and asks the reader to define it&amp;mdash;suddenly&amp;mdash;in their head. This question calls up our national myth, of virile men casting off the oppressive British yoke, which implants in Americans a desire for revolution and newness and independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this desire each time I encounter American colonial history. There is the Massachusetts Bay colonizers, and the Virginia Company of London, more than anything else I want to race forward to 1776. American history teaching defaults to setting our cast of characters on the North American continent in order to reach revolution, with that noble end somehow justifying everything that came before (if not ethically, then morally: we suffered, and thus &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; Freedom). In the same way, the outposts of our frontiersmen and women served to legitimize the murder of indigenous people, conquest of Mexican territory, and deaths of our own colonizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this myth may be just that, it is a powerful story that is consistently told. Hughes rides its momentum, immediately clipping America&amp;rsquo;s great strides towards Freedom with the realities of chattel slavery. Nothing could be further from Freedom. But Hughes is acknowledging the promise of Freedom: one&amp;rsquo;s heart can&amp;rsquo;t break if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t first beat. By acknowledging the promise along with its failure, Hughes ties this heartbreak inextricably to our nation&amp;rsquo;s founding. This is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; American heartbreak, bound up with the 400-year history of democracy in Jamestown. Hughes pulls us&amp;mdash;with present tense, with reference to Jamestown, by describing something so hard, so immovable, so central to that other early colony&amp;mdash;into the contradiction hidden in our nation&amp;rsquo;s founding, and still so hidden today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Things I Learned from my Marathon</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/16/3-things-i-learned-from-my-marathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/16/3-things-i-learned-from-my-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me avoid&amp;mdash;for all our sakes&amp;mdash;transforming my blog into a clichéd, over-exposed photo essay of my personal struggle running. That being said, I was struck, as it was impossible not to be, by several aspects of the race weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marathons are a fucking business. The City of Richmond anaesthetized its downtown and a good chunk of its of the scenery for this event. Unimaginably, the $100 entry fees are well-priced (at least for the marathon). Every mile brought, alternately, water, powerade, and port-a-johns or a live band. The entire day preceding was filled with events and vendors at Richmond&amp;rsquo;s convention center. In addition to the requisite race shirt, medal, and very necessary blanket, the finish line included yoga sessions, beer on tap, and pizza, all included. Meeting this massive coordination of resources were runners&amp;mdash;truly of all types&amp;mdash;swaddled in air-wicking this and energy-conserving that. They came and came, some twenty odd thousand, the majority towing families, friends, and track clubs. As a lone runner with 4 year-old shoes, all this &lt;em&gt;baggage&lt;/em&gt; was so apparent. And sometimes this baggage wanted to make itself known, with a glimmering wristwatch or suspension systems for their extraneous gear. At day&amp;rsquo;s end, however, there are no shortcuts through 26.2 miles. Your \$250 Vaporfly&amp;rsquo;s are no match for my ragged Kinvara 5&amp;rsquo;s if my breath is measured and stride high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My stride, however, was not high. This was absolutely an ordeal, if not quite of epic proportions. Due mostly to the hard shock of tarmac and my injury-diminished mileage these last few weeks, my calves began to make their presence felt about 4 miles in, which was about 10 miles earlier than I had hoped. Still, Richmond&amp;rsquo;s gentle terrain kept my pretty good until mile 16, when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wind made forward progress suddenly a thing to think about, instead of do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dinner finally caught up with me
Fighting these knocked me out of a stride I had found for the first time around the half-marathon mark. I made it through the next ten miles because of the runners showing me left and right how to fight, and the outstanding spectators. During my training, I probably saw a total of 200 people, most of which were at a single park in Charlottesville. Here I could not run 100 meters without a banana, a high-five, or a swig of Miller Lite. At mile 21, I heard the first call for &lt;strong&gt;BEER&lt;/strong&gt;, and double taked, able to snake across the road to the last volunteer. That helped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was as much a marathon as it was a real estate tour. I had always drove through Monument Ave. and thought it quaint in comparison to New Orleans&amp;rsquo; St. Charles St. It turns out that is not where Richmond&amp;rsquo;s wealthy live. Continue on Monument, crossing over the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199977260.001.0001/acprof-9780199977260-chapter-12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;freeway built to punish Black neighborhoods for school integration&lt;/a&gt;, and you&amp;rsquo;ll enter Henrico County. There Riverview Dr. follows lazily the James, and hundred-acre estates dominate both City and County waterfronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Parasite Refreshes Horror with a Hefty Dose of Social Realism</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/11/parasite-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/11/parasite-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 11/15/2019: check &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/parasite-refreshes-horror-with-a-hefty-dose-of-social-realism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; out at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No review—drawn inevitably from the vocabulary and lessons of preceding films—will do the novelty and creativity of Bong Joon-ho’s masterpiece justice. &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; is the best film to be released since &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt;, possibly since &lt;em&gt;12 Years a Slave&lt;/em&gt;. *Parasite*’s uncanny setting makes possible its combination of comedy and horror that justifies the second act’s shocking twists. In this way, it can be seen as the Korean and class counterpart to Get Out, with more emphasis on the realism than the horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is set in a contemporary Metropolis: its sprawling poverty serves the hermetically-sealed homes of the super-rich. Bong dances over the border between these realms, following—classically—the help that enters and exits these homes daily. In the title credits, we watch a drunk piss on the English basement-home of our star family, who are unemployed and failing to keep up with the vagaries of capitalism. When an unexpected chance to tutor at the home of a super-rich family opens, our family jumps at the opportunity. This first hour is a riot. Full of wit, we see them exploit the naïvete of the super-rich, locating the meaning behind ‘parasite’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But *Parasite*’s trick is its information imbalances. In Act I, our family colludes to carve out for themselves a way to live. Act II see-saws back this imbalance. Events begin to happen to our family rather than by our family. Still, Bong doesn’t shroud us in a JJ Abrams information fog, with terrors leaping out from dark corners of the screen. Instead, we see how the super-rich, themselves, feed off Korea’s underclass, dictating their schedule, their names, their words. Their financial insecurity keeps them in the thrall of this rich family, and pushes them to box out any competitors. These economically-violent delights have physically-violent ends. Where many films inspect class, the invisible fence that separates rich and poor, this film inspects wealth’s first derivative, inequality: we watch in real time as those invisible fences are built. &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; shows how the cherries that top the artisanal cakes drip with the blood of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to derail any work that I am doing is by linking to an article ranking and comparing things that will help me live a better life. That article might rank the 10 best productivity apps, it may uncover new services which partition and categorize every second of my day, or&amp;mdash;as it did yesterday&amp;mdash;it could offer me a phone that can satisfy my needs immediately, stripping my day of wasted time. The only certainty is that I, in my manifold time management skills, will click on that link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a phenomenon entirely local to myself until I saw this &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/essays/how-did-being-happy-become-a-matter-of-relentless-competitive-work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from Aeon, noting that life management has become a juggernaut in consumer retail, with &amp;ldquo;self-care and anti-stress products now rounding out the bestseller list on Amazon&amp;rdquo;. We&amp;rsquo;ve reined in other animals, organizations of people, and our bodies by calibrating each measurable parameter, so why not do the same for our minds? Unfortunately, we don&amp;rsquo;t seem quite as pliant as the optimization equations imply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic, made inexorable by limitless access to information, tugs at our happiness. Behind whatever tool or activity or person present before us lurks an alternative, a next-best option. This idea has driven every rationalist attempt at decision making, but its actual calculus has changed considerably since the 1990s. Before then, catalogued libraries and television delivered then-unprecedented access to information. The task of research had become immediately more accessible, but also less clear. Suddenly, more and more causes sprang up to explain each effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move from card catalogues and TV to Wikipedia and on-demand streaming was a leap in this dimension. Different from past moves was the sheer scale of new information. The closest comparison to make would likely be the telegram that could relay news around the world in minutes, but that did not solve the last-mile problem that our phones and computers did. Similar to past moves is the growing illusion of choice. Most definitions model illusory choice as a free decision between a constrained set of options, like choosing from a soda machine that offers a dozen brands but where every choice is a Coca-Cola product. But rather than onstrained options, I interpret illusory choice as constrained decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brain budgets time and resources based on prior neurological sequences, updating expectations with each iteration. While we may understand how normal it is not to find an exhaustive cost-benefits comparison of the more than 2,000 results for &amp;ldquo;thimble&amp;rdquo; on Amazon, our brains may not. Our expectations have been conditioned by the norms of evidence-based administration to treat anything less than exhaustive comparisons as failure. This extends to our lives, where exhaustive comparison has meant nothing less than exhaustion. Where once, exhaustive comparisons meant eyeballing dozens, now it means eyeballing hundreds, thousands, or millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our internal search processes can&amp;rsquo;t handle such scale. While they have gradually widened, the velocity of extension by the market has effectively capped the rate at which we had to develop non-exhaustive ways to search. When the village had a single cobbler, shoes were a constant, not a variable to optimize over. Still, when there are ten types of black beans at the grocery store, they can be compared quite readily. But when it&amp;rsquo;s always possible to opt for peer-to-peer sellers in Kolkata over the ~local~ Walmart, people are given the room every day to exhaust their critical thinking skills trying to gauge the expected payoffs of a hundred options, and a million more they know to be lurking, accessible to anyone with the right search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our minds haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up yet. They can take on waves of epic proportions, but a tide that lifts them high enough to see the world&amp;rsquo;s ginormity will overwhelm. I see two ways out: time and pragmatism. The first just says that after enough time passes, our minds will adjust, will think in different ways to approach this different problem. But that option offers only consolation to people currently. Option two offers that different way. Construct in your mind a noble lie, something appealing but fanciful. Then, believe in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adhering to a set of values fixes those variables as constants. This is Marie Kondo for your mind, with the tiny caveat that beliefs weigh far more than shower organizers, dressers, or homes. The values chosen don&amp;rsquo;t have to conform to Marie Kondo&amp;ndash;like advice. In fact, choosing something already at tension with what FastCompany promises are the best ways to increase productivity is probably best. It&amp;rsquo;s good training for the future. Rather, pick values that will let you do the most of your wants, your in-the-moment pleasures. Do not conflate &amp;lsquo;do the most&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;most choices&amp;rsquo;. To do the most, you need clear boundaries that, if crossed, bind you to decisions, decisions that you could theoretically even come to regret, but decisions that you need to make. Pragmatism means believing what needs to be believed, even if it can&amp;rsquo;t stand up to rationalist inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>20 Miles Later</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/10/20/20-miles-later/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 4 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll toe the line at the VCU Health ^[Kudos to VCU for ending their practice of suing patients for non-payment! I wish the same could be said for UVA.] &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richmondmarathon.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Richmond Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. This last month has seen me run consistently farther than I ever had before, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had to find new places to keep my legs and mind busy. At four weeks out, most marathon plans advocate for a very long run, of about 20 miles. I did it yesterday, and I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure if my calves will be ready to go &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; Saturday, let alone tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, Charllottesville has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rivannatrails.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;beautiful 20-mile trail&lt;/a&gt; that circumscribes the city. All of the lands are City parks or private easements, so it tends to be corners of property and scraps of backyards, and a lot of dilapidated industry. But the isolation can be unnerving: I can count on a single hand the amount of women I have seen run alone during the 15+ hours I&amp;rsquo;ve spent on it. There are several sections where the trail curls and the trees lean over and I think to myself &lt;em&gt;what a wonderful place to be attacked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the vast majority of the trail isn&amp;rsquo;t like this. Much of the trail parallels Charlottesville&amp;rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods, where residents have had to deal with me confronting a lot of my own privilege. The vast majority is me, clohtes only in 5&amp;rdquo; running shorts, a watch, and sneakers taking up space and air outside someone else&amp;rsquo;s home. Here it&amp;rsquo;s the lack of clothing and equipment that define my position. I have a place to store my clothing, I have the resources to clean my sweaty shorts three times a week, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to bring my phone because I&amp;rsquo;m confident no one will look at me like I want their money. For a few minutes each Saturday I take in the atmosphere outside your home, leaving only the sound of my shoes pounding the trail, and my lungs heaving slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distortion in Vertigo (1958)</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/08/27/vertigo-1958/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/08/27/vertigo-1958/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 10/20/2019: check &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/the-all-american-gaze-distorted-perspective-in-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; out at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitchcock’s cinematographic style changes with each script and year in which he immerses himself, unlike the storybook qualities of Wes Anderson or the placid &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/665415-drops-dripped-quiet-talk-went-on-horses-neighed-and-scuffled&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drops dripped&lt;/a&gt; of Andrei Tarkovsky. &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19078948&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dizzying heights&lt;/a&gt; of Hitchcock’s mastery, leads us into John Ferguson’s (James Stewart) mind&amp;mdash;distorted by the lethal, dozen-story fall of a partner trying to save Ferguson&amp;mdash;by forcing us into cramped spaces and mocking our spatial judgment. I argue that in doing so, Hitchcock forces viewers to understand the disorientation and claustrophobia that Ferguson so clearly feels. In doing so, Hitchcock makes reasonable the otherwise unreasonable male gaze of Ferguson and, by association, the effects that gaze causes, though it’s unclear whether it serves to morally justify that gaze. So, in-movie, Hitchcock uses film technique to warp what would otherwise be a black-and-white judgment about Ferguson’s behavior towards Judy Barton (Kim Novak).  Out-of-movie, I finally make the claim that this in-movie phenomenon critiques white American masculinity’s treatment of the Other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this analysis was impossible for me until I considered David Lynch’s &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;there were too many motifs in &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; to grab a hold of! Hitchcock employs a &lt;a href=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/514a2911e4b0896b36342655/1482995944327-EWLBUKOGUEVV2J7984Q3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDJVOyiZxV_-dowl7sRu02MUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYwL8IeDg6_3B-BRuF4nNrNcQkVuAT7tdErd0wQFEGFSnM_12NgTIazSm1At4R8ulVAcqDD8dBOmEycJv1fx_vd3MyvpBiIzzydoM1I6fLa65Q/image-asset.png?format=2500w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;contrasting color palette&lt;/a&gt;, his signature(ly disturbing) perplexion with blonde women, and an unforgettable break in narrative. &lt;em&gt;Mulholland&lt;/em&gt; offers those motifs amped up to surrealistic proportions, with color palettes at near antagonistic levels, the blondes shining ever more platinum, though its narrative break is difficult to pinpoint. Connecting &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; makes the interpretation of Hitchcock’s film no easier, but facilitates a shift in mindset that rendered Vertigo much more interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean this: Lynch is enigmatic as hell, but he continues to give interviews. In these interviews, he surrenders much of his creativity to what he terms “dream-logic”, and it stands out immediately. Dream-logic connects two objects despite their inconsistencies according to logic-logic. Such an approach finds its Western roots entirely recent, coming primarily out of Sigmund Freud’s &lt;em&gt;Interpretation of Dreams&lt;/em&gt;. Its epistemology is usually visual in [Lynch’s] movies, though connections via homonym or punnery are entirely within the bounds of Freudian analysis. While a novelty in 2001 &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt; premiered, 1958 saw psychoanalysis at its peak of influence. This rise crashed into Hitchcock’s prior work with film noir, convoluted plots that often involved damaged detectives and female subjects vulnerable physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; synthesizes these two strands. Kim Novak’s characters—one before, one after the narrative break—vie for their freedom against their supposed history. In classic Hitchcock fashion, &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; can be summarized as a Wrong Man Film,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:cf-The-Wrong-Man&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:cf-The-Wrong-Man&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where the protagonist is mistaken for a doppelgänger implicated in deep, deep shit. Unclassically, *Vertigo*’s protagonist is no man; and its protagonist(s) is/are not its central character(s). Novak’s Judy Barton is modeled (mostly) against her will after a prior, dead San Francisco socialite, Madeleine Ester,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Novak-in-Act-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Novak-in-Act-1&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who herself models a [much more] prior, dead San Francisco socialite. The complicity of each in creating their respective &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iron cloaks&lt;/a&gt; of identity is uncertain, but beside the point—Ferguson’s male gaze visualizes these identities before they are realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often enough, the male gaze is analyzed as a whole, apart from its sometimes very specific set of eyes. I get at Ferguson’s specific set through Hitchcock’s motifs and cinematography. Ferguson’s gaze is set very literally in the film’s opening. Hitchcock shakes up the presumably keen vision of a detective with his partner’s death. The fall and the height and the guilt confuse themselves in Ferguson’s head to deliver a crippling case of vertigo, rendering him unproductive and idle, unmoored from his former senses of intelligence. There is nothing objective against which Ferguson can mark the damage his trauma wrought, no other detectives to which he can compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitchock will signify this psychosis slowly at first, then all at once. This chronological pattern approximates the spiral imagery so fundamental to &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;. Saul Bass’ iconic movie poster design depicts Ferguson plunging into a line-drawn spiral. This third dimension is added, and reflects the way objects track in wide-diameter circles, speeding as the circles shrink and finally encloses the object.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Cf-This-comical&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Cf-This-comical&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Concerned of the obsession his wife (Madeleine) exhibits for a suicidal ancestor, Ferguson’s friend sends him to play private detective. While Scottie takes logical steps to follow the wife’s story, his social isolation and physical trauma get the better of him. His steps culminate in a famous leap into the brisk San Francisco Bay, where, just before, Madeleine plunged, unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ih-KeOf3xQQ/maxresdefault.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;*Vertigo*’s massive field of view.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the dive in, James Ferguson can never quite get himself on solid ground. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.abelardomorell.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2017_Flowers-For-Lisa-76-After-Hitchcock%E2%80%99s-Vertigo-2017-copy-1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;spiral patterns&lt;/a&gt; begin to crop up in paintings, department stores, cemeteries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I5ob7SqVmUQ/T1rcELu28SI/AAAAAAAACaM/bt6R6pd-4a0/s1600/Hitchcock+Vertigo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The tight spiral of Madeleine, her ancestor, and eventually Judy connects the three in Ferguson’s dream-logic.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught in the inner circles of a deepening plot and deepening conspiracy, Hitchcock simulates what Ferguson’s deepening psychosis&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; must feel like with cinematographic trickery that encloses Ferguson’s figure, disclosing the craze lurking inside his obsessed mind. In *Vertigo*’s camerawork, deep focus and a 2-D plane forces our visual cortex to compare the near and far. The video below demonstrates this several times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/bDwPJ5IaJ2g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those yellow flowers that Scottie walks behind at 1:59 appear taller than him in that moment, and the obscured view traps his figure in the history, mystery, and death that linger after Novak exits the scene. Hitchcock further unsettles viewers in :17, not with the normal technique of a dolly following Ferguson and suggesting danger, but with a shot from below. This camera setting exaggerates the height and length of objects outside focal point, making the 3ft flowers equal the 6ft Ferguson in height. The mastery here is the unresolved tension between these instances of camera trickery and Hitchcock’s concurrent attention to truly large objects. The enormity of the Golden Gate bridge in one famous shot anchors the nearly surreal imagery elsewhere in &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, cementing a permanent unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add this to the geologic folding that turns ordinary car following into labyrinthine mazes:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/fNyUpJGEnR4?t=73&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And of course, *Vertigo*’s signature camera effect, the zoom-in/dolly-out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/O888bu0QrMg?t=56&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The spirals (2:13), the huge objects (:36), the zoom-in/dolly-out (1:20) culminate in *Vertigo*’s quasi-climax:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/GjPCk494e5Q&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The scene in Mission San Juan Bautista also bears striking resemblances to the work of Italian surrealist Giorgio de Chirico. De Chirico’s work produces a sense of unease through its emphasis on the uncanny, that which is not quite and yet almost is. I like to think of a composite image, the subimages of which are all perfectly possible, though the composite somehow not being possible. In the image below, which reminds me both of the Mission and the ever-out-of-reach Madeleine, the sky is a natural color for sunsets and the long shadows possible at twilight, but the building is so bright and the shadows so stark that the image could not possibly depict a real event. Hitchcock, toeing the sur/realism line, never leaves us with quite the uncanny images or impossible geometries to prove the sort of dream-logic that Lynch would make explicit, but these scenes add up. With snaking streets, out-of-proportion objects, and color palette, builds a profile of the uncanny without ever letting us put a finger on it. Like Ferguson, the viewer is hard-pressed to resolve the visual inputs Hitchcock offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/Gou4x1ymnaWvmfhCgIsalNJKlyZ04HiczUsV3K7mJbNanian5d0xowY3sDAaWLcOUIwbbkvajPRVBCH9Zy8eBx5g/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Giorgio de Chirico&#39;s Metaphysical Art movement&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of confusion invites resolution for the viewer into a reality-less vacuum. Similarly, while Ferguson is a detective, used to getting to the Bottom of Things, he can’t in this situation. All his preternatural detective powers have been duped by trauma and deceit. He is painfully aware which way is up and which down, but not much beyond that. Through all the twists and turns, Ferguson never understands (or rather, never is able to convince himself he understands) Madeleine. The history (of Madeleine, of Dolores, etc.) regresses too far for his eyes to penetrate. Unable to free himself from this convoluted plot and detached from reality, Ferguson imposes a narrative on Judy. &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; now makes her tick. And the viewer accepts this to some degree because the story is resolution-deficient. Trapped staring through Ferguson’s gaze, escape is&amp;mdash;depending on the specific viewer&amp;mdash;to some extent preferable, even when it carries such gross implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endgame of Ferguson’s gaze is sex. The male gaze conjures scenarios&amp;mdash;no matter how fantastical&amp;mdash;where legally-consensual&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Otherwise-one-wo&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Otherwise-one-wo&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; sex occurs, and relates those scenarios with the real world in order to judge their plausibility, filtering those implausible scenarios from the gazer’s strategies. A plausible scenario would mean that Ferguson has successfully dissected her, inducting her motives, and&amp;mdash;with them in hand&amp;mdash;~smooth-talked~ her into thinking that his motives overlap with hers. But since Ferguson cannot understand Judy, because he cannot relate fantasy with reality, he resorts to the truly outrageous step of &lt;em&gt;realizing&lt;/em&gt; those fantastical scenarios and their absurd bargaining power disparities, molding Judy so that her [perceived] motives can be &lt;em&gt;induced&lt;/em&gt; to comport with Ferguson’s desires. This decision fabricates the conscience-satisfying, superficially-consensual sex that ends &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;. Horrifically, the viewers’ interests are sympathetic to Ferguson’s, begging for plot resolution, but are then [hopefully] spoiled when they are confronted with the idea that their interests imply the exploitation of Judy. From beneath the comfort of 1950’s American entertainment, a violent man watches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interpreting the greater significance of &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, I benefit again from viewing Hitchcock through Lynch’s rear window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be. But on the cherry tree there&amp;rsquo;s this pitch oozing out – some black, some yellow, and millions of red ants crawling all over it. I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; red ants underneath.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Lynch-David-and&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Lynch-David-and&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitchcock views America somewhat from the outside. He picks a very particular part of the US, one where the histories of people who were not British is readily apparent in depictions of frontier life (and Native death). This choice primarily works to operate on the level of uncanny history, a history that few are equipped to read completely into their own history of America, but with pieces that all can recognize. It’s therefore both easy to dissociate Ferguson’s particular position from their own, while difficult to completely disentangle the silver screen from real life. Stewart’s roles prior to &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; included US everyman turned Congressman in &lt;em&gt;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&lt;/em&gt;, aviator Charles Lindbergh in &lt;em&gt;The Spirit of St. Louis&lt;/em&gt;, a cowboy in &lt;em&gt;Winchester ‘73&lt;/em&gt;, George Bailey in &lt;em&gt;It’s a Wonderful Life&lt;/em&gt;. I cannot think of another actor who so embodied rich, moral American-ness during this time. Hitchcock then takes apart this rich, moral, American figure by finding within him obsession, formidable sexuality, and desperation. A bit of psychological trauma sets off (or reveals?) the ants in this cherry tree. &lt;strong&gt;More specifically, the bent of America is towards taking that which/who is not ours and assimilating them, without dealing with “underlying” issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it difficult to read Hitchcock as directing in so critical a fashion as I have just suggested, given the patent fetishism of Kim Novak’s characters. In that vein, I would echo the interpretation of American men above, but stop short of believing Hitchcock to be fully critical. For him, I don’t think the discomfort of Judy’s situation outweighs his fetish for Novak. While &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; is a unique instance of 1950’s filmmaking for its unsettling features and early integration of psychoanalysis, I’m not convinced of any allegations of intent on Hitchcock’s part. It very well may be that old Alfred was the astute critic I have made him to be, but it could equally (in my eyes) be the case that he was utterly obsessed with Novak. To resolve *Vertigo*’s interpretation would be to impose, for all but the most ardent individualist, an idea of its meaning absent context of its author. While I generally distance myself from arguments about authorial intent, I do not want to foreclose the possibility of its import to other viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;Note that this means thoughts become detached from external reality. When we understand that no person can diagnose another from anywhere but their own viewpoint firmly in the mainstream of productive society, it becomes clear that the usage of the word ‘reality’ is misleading. Reality does not exist&amp;mdash;it is judged to exist&amp;mdash;but always with psychology this judgment originates from the highly-educated professional class. Understanding what ‘external reality’ entails means Ferguson could both be “detached from external reality” and quite rational in both his and the viewers’ eyes. Hitchcock plays on this truth in many films. Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean somebody isn’t out to get you. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created an &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; client to fetch data from the Federal Register, replacing an R package that had not been updated for years. It was my first foray into APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.federalregister.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; is the [slowly] clearing house for every revision to US administrative law, regulatory enforcement, and the more stupid forms of jockeying and horn-tooting by federal agencies. The website, charged with the supremely bureaucratic duty of pigeonholing and circumscribing every sort of &amp;lt;&lt;event&gt;&amp;gt; in Washington, is quite beautiful. Its ease, features, and appearance bear the marks of something that is truly for the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To aid readers, [and the odd corporation trying to stay a step ahead of environmental regulations,] the Office of the Federal Register got a leg up from a developer who made an API client for R. Unfortunately,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:And-quite-ironic&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:And-quite-ironic&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that client has been rendered useless by updates. In the name of openness digital and governmental, I set to work on a new API client that would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach me the fundamentals of APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;display some clever solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:And-quite-ironic&#34;&gt;And quite ironically for an institution with steeped in such bureaucracy. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:And-quite-ironic&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
