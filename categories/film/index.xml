      <title>In Vertigo (1958), an Uncertain History</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.historyguide.org/europe/valery.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;We see now that the abyss of history is deep enough to hold us all.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; places a thoroughly modern Scottie Ferguson&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Jimmy-Stewart&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Jimmy-Stewart&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; within a thoroughly modern San Francisco.
It then watches as he slips from his mental moorings into a twisted version of himself.
His cycle of psychological terror constitutes a violent &lt;em&gt;displacement&lt;/em&gt;, and it re-opens two key questions of belonging: of Scottie to San Francisco; and of San Francisco to Scottie.
I will examine only the former today; the latter I leave for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My argument runs like this:
&lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s early scenes depict a San Francisco that is tailored to mobile white men like Scottie.
For his part, Scottie enforced the modern status quo as a San Francisco cop, until his partner died trying to save Scottie from falling during a rooftop chase.
With the danger supposedly over, he finds himself navigating a comfortable and controlled city, with sights/sites located just off the highway&amp;mdash;Fort XX, the Muir Woods, and the Mission San Juan Bautista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these parks did not just happen.
Public works efforts had to make the sites palettable to professionals and tourists.
These efforts had to isolate the visual cues of danger from any actual, Wild West&amp;ndash;type danger.
Rather than places to be reckoned with, these are sights to be gawked at.
In the first formulation, the site&amp;mdash;with all its natural and political forces&amp;mdash;participates with those who visit it; in the second, only the visitor is active, while the sight is frozen in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; exposes how thin this veneer of safety is.
Between Madeleine&amp;rsquo;s actions and Scottie&amp;rsquo;s vertigo, the film reintroduces the distinct possibilities of danger to these places.
In doing so, it unsettles the stable relationship between Scottie the subject and San Francisco the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contend that a stable subject-object relationship is necessary to Scottie&amp;rsquo;s sense of place; as evidence, I look to his meeting with Gavin Elster.
#Elster meeting exposes Scottie&amp;rsquo;s desires
##Scottie kind of had this with the police force, but he has been neutered and immobilized (the placement)
##Also exposes what SF lacks
#He likes going to these &amp;ldquo;old places&amp;rdquo; b/c he feels powerful and free there, his very life in defiance of the tall trees, colonial forces, and rough seas
##these parks serve as reminders of the passage of time, but they are as much participants in it
##so, unbeknownst to Scottie, the parks lost their oldness. Therefore, the power he feels is invalid
#Madeleine exposes real danger
##This unsettles the relationship, because he now feels the danger
##this change makes it such that he can confuse now with the past
##this flattening of history disorients scottie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a private reading of &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;.
To&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By disrupting the normal order of things, &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; thus undermines our () grip of America over San Francisco, and, in doing so, its narrative of progress.
This disruption contributes to a &amp;ldquo;weakening of historicity, both in our relationship to public History and in the new forms of our private temporality&amp;rdquo;.^[Frederic Jameson, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110806060217/http://homepage.newschool.edu/~quigleyt/vcs/jameson/jameson.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Here &amp;lsquo;historcity&amp;rsquo; is that sense that things have changed somehow in our social relations.
By exposing progress as a veneer, Hitchock traps us in a spiral that mirrors Scottie Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s own difficulty escaping his traumatic past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;establishing-a-modern-city-via-the-american-sublime&#34;&gt;Establishing a modern city via the American sublime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the flâneur, Gavin Elster)? american tech sublime and the double action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disrupting-the-illusion-of-safety&#34;&gt;Disrupting the illusion of safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely something here about the fragility of the sublime
Madeleine puncturing the visual membrane of the sublime&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sublime, rather than an instrument which rattles people from their parochial understandings of history to glean a new future, turns them toward a never-ending past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; is often viewed as the modernist movie. Here instead it is an early example of postmodernism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s lasting images star San Francisco as much as they do Jimmy Stewart or Kim Novak.
Consider for example the massive pylons supporting the Golden Gate Bridge, the looming trunks of Muir Woods, or the towering figure cut by the Mission San Juan Bautista.
These are objects so huge that Hitchcock&amp;rsquo;s camera cannot swallow them entirely, their vastness bleeding over the frame&amp;rsquo;s edges.
And each of them repeat vertical features&amp;mdash;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_orange#Golden_Gate_Bridge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Orange&lt;/a&gt; suspension cables, endless &lt;em&gt;Sequoia sempervirens&lt;/em&gt;, late-afternoon shadows cast by pale white arches&amp;mdash;that recede into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Succession and uniformity of parts are what constitute the artificial infinite&amp;rdquo; wrote Edmund Burke in &lt;em&gt;A Philosophical Enquiry Into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, one of the first modern explorations of the sublime.
He described the sublime as a state when &amp;ldquo;the mind is so entirely filled with its object, that it cannot entertain any other,&amp;rdquo; inciting terror and astonishment at its heights, while &amp;ldquo;the inferior effects are admiration, reverence and respect.&amp;rdquo;
The treatment Hitchcock gives to San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s iconic sights meets Burke&amp;rsquo;s standard.
But what purpose does this treatment serve? How does the voyeurism of Hitchcock&amp;rsquo;s camera change the meaning of these vistas? &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;is this a question for the other post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These images represent a particular kind of sublime associated with a particular kind of political project.
While great magnitude and manifold features are part of Burke&amp;rsquo;s sublime, he later disavows &amp;ldquo;colonnades and avenues of trees [&amp;hellip;] suffered to run to immense distances&amp;rdquo; as urbane.
However, the ultimate height of construction (and of trees) was not foreseen by Burke in 1757: the technical and natural discoveries in nineteenth-century and early-twentieth-century America would dwarf those of eighteenth-century Europe.
Moreover, metropolitans worldwide realized the need to incorporate great sights into their cityscapes.
Historian David Nye writes of an American technological sublime, a fusion of American technical mastery and pre-American resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue that this modification of Burke&amp;rsquo;s typology (which had separated the sublime into natural and architectural modes) can be used to better understand how the expansive imagery in &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; contributes to a &amp;ldquo;weakening of historicity, both in our relationship to public History and in the new forms of our private temporality&amp;rdquo;.^[Frederic Jameson, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110806060217/http://homepage.newschool.edu/~quigleyt/vcs/jameson/jameson.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Keeping with &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/the-all-american-gaze-distorted-perspective-in-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my earlier analysis of the film&lt;/a&gt;, I maintain that &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; presents both a private message concerning Scottie Ferguson&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Portrayed-by-Jim&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Portrayed-by-Jim&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a public message about the social geography of 1950&amp;rsquo;s America.
In the interest of clarity, I focus today only on the public message, detailing how the American sublime clashes pre-modernity with modernity, disorienting Scottie&amp;rsquo;s experience of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-drives-scottie&#34;&gt;What drives Scottie?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the sublime images in &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; begins with understanding how Scottie encounters such pictures.
Since the film is shot (mostly) from his perspective, Hitchcock&amp;rsquo;s treatment of the Golden Gate, the Muir Woods, and the Mission all derive from Scottie.
While his desires have been the subject of several careers in film studies, it will help to simplify by looking at the film itself for direction.
Stewart&amp;rsquo;s body language clues us in to the gravity of his encounter with Gavin Elster, Madeleine&amp;rsquo;s husband.
As Nerdwriter &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgnNakO6JZw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;demonstrates&lt;/a&gt;, this meeting has so much to do with each man&amp;rsquo;s power.
This short exchange seems to encapsulate much of the two men&amp;rsquo;s urges:

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/udMms5FKyok?t=47&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

And in the script:
&amp;gt;ELSTER: San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s changed. The things that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
SCOTTIE: (Scottie smiles at the old prints [of a small, façaded San Francisco surrounded by dangerous and rocky terrain] on the wall.) Like all this.
ELSTER: (Nodding) I&amp;rsquo;d like to have lived here then. The color and excitement&amp;hellip; the power&amp;hellip;  the freedom.
(Though he does not stress the word, the way he lingers softly on the word &amp;ldquo;Freedom&amp;rdquo; makes Scottie look over at him again. Elster looks up and smiles companionably.)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Alec-Coppel-Samu&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Alec-Coppel-Samu&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the mechanisms by which 1950s San Francisco distances itself from its Wild West past&amp;mdash;the long sequences in sleek automobiles, the infrequent references to psychiatry, a brassiere operating by &amp;ldquo;the principle of the cantilever bridge&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;are here disavowed in favor of a dangerous and unfamiliar past.
That bra symbolizes surprisingly much of the city&amp;rsquo;s changes.
Its &amp;ldquo;revolutionary uplift&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Vertigo-script-P&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Vertigo-script-P&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are designed for the pleasure of men, as much of city&amp;rsquo;s attractions were.
Meanwhile, the comfort provided by the innovative architecture undoubtedly improved women&amp;rsquo;s lives, albeit in small ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By including men and women, the bra is thus a factor of the democratic virtues of the American technological sublime outlined by David Nye.
But it is also a product of that historical concept, designed by an engineer in his spare time, a &amp;ldquo;kind of do-it-yourself thing,&amp;rdquo; as Scottie notes.
This spirit of tinkering that came from outside the state apparatus and wealthy class is the reason why &amp;ldquo;Engineers, builders, and inventors began to occupy [&amp;hellip;] the pantheon of republicanism.&amp;ldquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:David-Nye-The-Am&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:David-Nye-The-Am&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The bra (by its inventor, its target audience, its cantilever design) symbolizes how invention, innovation, and ambitious construction catered to America&amp;rsquo;s middle class.
These criteria of the American sublime would have been alien to a pre-modern San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the above is but the first move in Nye&amp;rsquo;s distinctive double action of the American sublime.
Where that first move &amp;ldquo;usurped the place of natural things with man-made objects” conceived as &amp;ldquo;internal improvements”, the second move covered the tracks of the first, assimilating the object of improvement as once again natural.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>David Lynch is Toying With Us</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2020/02/15/david-lynch-is-toying-with-us/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2020/02/15/david-lynch-is-toying-with-us/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I write this post while watching &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt;, a work of exceptional mystery but unexceptional tension.
Lynch casts two regulars&amp;mdash;Laura Harring and Naomi Watts&amp;mdash;opposite one newbie&amp;mdash;Scott Coffey&amp;mdash;as man-sized rabbits in what appears to be the &lt;em&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;/em&gt; apartment set.
These short films, available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSSx9jvH6luUPl-bqfqaJ8z8vHDqlu5ji&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, trip over several of Lynch&amp;rsquo;s signature aspects: characters sing haunting songs; mundane life is treated as a social experiment; and Angelo Baldametti&amp;rsquo;s synthesizers underscore everything.
&lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt; insists that we examine our own tastes and be comfortable with those answers (and inevitably unanswered questions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it offers no plot or characters that could create tension in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j56WPBaiPYQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conventional story structure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt; is seriously intriguing, and hints at larger, unobserved meanings.
This intrigue is not uncommon; in fact, my theory of late has been that Lynch understands that his viewers feel the hints and the suggestions at something grander, his films all metaphysical McGuffins.
In his films, characters do not look at one another&amp;mdash;they see, in flashy close-ups, the uncertain eyes of the other.
Leading women are never conventionally pretty&amp;mdash;they are fantastically upbeat and implausibly platinum, hysterical results of Hollywood insecure appeal to men&amp;rsquo;s wallets.
Cars do not traverse from point to point&amp;mdash;headlights sprint over dark, twisting roadways.
These are cinematic clichés, style that heightens substance when it is used eagerly and genuinely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/04/18/lynchrabbits1024_wide-81b3911888e86e687da1a0370b19cc026967ef0d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Set of *Rabbits*. The camera moves from this fixed position exactly once to zoom in on the telephone.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is nothing substantive about &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt;: Lynch&amp;rsquo;s mastery over cinematic cliché is taken to the brink, and over.
In many Lynch films since &lt;em&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;/em&gt;, characters utter non-sequiters in total deadpan; but in &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt;, they utter nothing but non-sequiters, with no story to speak of!
This Baldametti score then adds style to substanceless grunts, sounds English speakers will recognize as words but not as meaningful sentences.
And with some serious hilarity, Lynch adds a sitcom applause over the entrances of each character into this one-room apartment and laughtracks after sentences like &amp;ldquo;It is 7pm&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I almost forgot.&amp;rdquo;
These outbursts, audio cues to at-home viewers that Important or Funny happenings are taking place, mock TV shows like the &lt;em&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;, whose live audiences treat academic jargon and references to comic books as the basis for side-splitting guffaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distance between the intelligibility of plot in &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt; and the connotations of its audio cues emphasize the contingency of language and the ability of convention to invent meaning from nothing.
It is indisputable that Baldametti&amp;rsquo;s score is ominous, alerting viewers that Something Is Happening, or that audience laughter is comedic, alerting viewers that a Joke Is Occurring.
But simply because a connotation is indisputable does not make it true.
None would dispute the scores ominousness or the audiences laughter because the years of TV and film that we have watch have taught us to connect certain sounds to certain moments.
The work starts with children&amp;rsquo;s tales, where morality is stark and the audio cues used to reinforce a grand, unified message.
By grounding these otherwise unintelligible cues in extra-cinematic morality or realistic emotions, we learn to couple low, industrial sounds with alertness, and human laughter with comedy.
&lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt; attempts to elicit those emotions by only employing the signifier, while ditching the plot points signified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NiOx5yJx-jc/maxresdefault.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The *Persona*-like dream sequences. Nothing says for sure these rabbits sleep, but shifts in color and a demonic face that hovers in the upper left-hand corner match dream sequences in Lynch&#39;s other films.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one can argue that the words which immediately precede and follow the &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;-like interpolated dream sequences are Important, but I am not convinced.
I propose that &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt; is David Lynch toying with us.
He wants to know if he can make pure entertainment, works without useful or familiar stories, but which nonetheless strap us into rollercoasters of joy, despair, nostalgia, and humor.
In his other works, this plays out seamlessly.
I (the viewer) achingly try to pin down the plot, and then the meaning of the narrative he created.
This process feels possible, but always out-of-reach in his other works, which ditch the rabbit heads and opt for sequences of dialog that I recognize as events and narrative momentum.
But in &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt;, the dissonance between signifier and signified makes the effect clear.
In &lt;em&gt;Rabbits&lt;/em&gt;, the laughter and music become parodic, pointing at the fact that in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; language, cinematic or otherwise, our grunts are intelligible for no reasons other than Pavolvian repitition and the magic fizz of neurons.
Language is contingent, subject to chance mutation and adoption, and not subject to deep structures or extra-personal validity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>*Just Mercy* – a Legal Drama Adaptation That Fails to Do Justice to a Compelling Memoir</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/12/25/just-mercy-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/12/25/just-mercy-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 1/20/2020: check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/just-mercy-a-legal-drama-adaptation-that-fails-to-do-justice-to-a-compelling-memoir/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Just Mercy*’s most powerful scenes concern three different people condemned to death, all legally represented by Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan). These scenes punctuate the film, as we witness Stevenson’s growth from timid law student to successful advocate for those on death row. The strengths of *Just Mercy*—the eponymous memoir by Stevenson—lie in its plot and the range of lives contained within. But while the movie safely navigates the politics of portraying incarceration and gross injustice, it runs aground by bashing its viewership over the head by over-telling a story well shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see, first, the timid intern some 800-miles south of Harvard to meet a man his own age on death row. We see, then, the execution of Herb Richardson, a veteran who developed PTSD during Vietnam and proceeded to detonate a bomb on a lover’s porch. Finally, we see Walter McMillan (Jamie Foxx) run the gauntlet of police and legal implements to win freedom for a crime he did not commit, that canonic Southern Sin of murdering a white woman whilst Black. This story dominates &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt;, and exposes features of the legal system in Monroeville, AL (the literary and extra-literary site of &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;) that the average viewer would not believe existed in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan cracks the ‘rational’ suspicions of the first two inmates, seeming both cool-headed and eager. He is at his best showing off these gifts, gifts the real Bryan Stevenson possesses, of blind understanding and unflappability. The stories of these men evoke grief and frustration without the aid of embellishment, and Just Mercy refrains admirably in their cases. And it is mostly free from fetish, a necessity that prisoner-centric films still neglect. With Walter McMillan, however, Jordan plays somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Walter McMillan, Stephenson transforms into the Atticus Finch archetype he jokes about. I had hoped for a courtroom monologue-free drama—true to life—but &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; just could not resist. Part of this discrepancy is a defect of the book-film transubstantiation: the book budgets roughly 10% of its pages to legal history and explaining the appeal process for Alabama death row inmates. Instead of devising some snappy montage (à la Michael Lewis film adaptations) explaining Alabama’s criminal processing and social statics showcasing racial disparities, &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt;, the movie, uses Jordan and legal assistant Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) as mouthpieces. What results are dialogues where both characters tell the other what they clearly already know. &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; has not caught the trend of making its viewers think, spoon-feeding plot and context at its own expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Jordan says what doesn’t need to be said. When he visits McMillan’s family, extended family, and neighbors, it’s clear that Bryan Stevenson cares, that he goes beyond to help this man and his family, that he does not indict the men he sees (legally or illegally) on death row. Jordan uses his tremendously expressive face—clenched jaws and furrowed brows, or his 500-watt smile—to summon indignation or pleasure. He could very well have been the right actor for this movie, but his script sounds trite, due to his own delivery and adjustments, or to an overzealous writer/producer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think much of *Just Mercy*’s shortcomings fall on director Destin Daniel Cretton, though surely the suits at Warner Bros. pushed the platitudes whenever possible. I do not mind adaptations heightening the drama of a book, but they must pass a few criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major plot events represented faithfully: Here, the movie receives close to full marks. The first meeting on death row, execution, and first trial are close to perfect, but the release of Walter McMillan sees Stevenson lecturing the courtroom before judgment is passed. This is stupid as well as melodramatic; part of the book’s brilliance is its emphasis on how pedestrian structural racism and indigent defense is in the legal system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding to this mis-adaption is the portrayal of Monroeville’s prosecutor. Prosecutors have jobs, they have staffs, and they have electorates. These facts make their jobs less about justice than legal statistics and relationships with the police department. In the final 16 minutes, the prosecutor somehow turns from the patronizing careerist of the first two hours to sheepish moral man in full realization of his mistake. In reality, the state’s case was untenable. There was no uplifting realization by the white prosecutor that justice had not been served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The adapted work’s environment communicated: This component is *Just Mercy*’s worst. The book leadens Stevenson’s journey with the twin histories of criminal prosecution and racism in America. As I mentioned before, the book resorts to chunky dialogue to explain basic facts of prosecution, but with no reference to the wider scope of these facts, no sense that these convictions happen in every jurisdiction in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embellishments add to the message: I’m of two minds here. Jordan’s sermonizing belies Stevenson’s cool-headed determination. He was not Thurgood Marshall in the courtroom. But the adjustments to Walter McMillan’s incarceration were, at times, nice substitutes. Never in the book does Walter engage in a single aggressive or even energetic act. Here we see him thrashing against the human restraints that envelop him. The sense of rage, devoid in the book, is understandable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; turns a book powerful for its facticality into something expected and over-determined. No one who reads the facts of this case would have the need to decipher, yet the all-too-familiar scenes of excessive force and righteousness of Michael B. Jordan as Bryan Stevenson are so obviously coded as to rob any viewers of their right to interpretation. The movie wins when getting out of its own way, offering the un-cinematic particularities (a scratchy record full of dread just before the electric chair) and plain humanity (Stevenson joking with his first client, about what he won’t say) of, you know, real humans. It is a poignant story of what it means for anyone with a modicum of power to remember the wrongs that have already happened instead of trying to inscribe their own story ignorant of what has come before. But check out the book instead from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1119116448&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;your local library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jojo Rabbit Explores Universal Notions of Morality through a Childlike Perspective</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/30/jojo-rabbit-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 11/30/2019: check &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/jojo-rabbit-explores-universal-notions-of-morality-through-a-childlike-perspective/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; out at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a Beaux Arts mashup of &lt;em&gt;The Great Dictator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; set inside a &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; prequel. Can’t? Taika Waititi has. &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; finds a small, timid Hitler Youth (the &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; bit) named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) in a world much too big for him. Waititi brings the fanaticism and anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany into close quarters by portraying Jojo’s imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler. His portrayal is an incredible use of dramatic irony: we see the craziness of Hitler’s cult of personality and ideology, while the ten year-old sees his idol. Same as any sports star, Jojo’s room is decked out in memorabilia and posters to the Führer’s power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waititi The Actor mirrors Chaplin by lampooning Hitler’s decisions and imitating his manner of speech. All the silliness you’d expect from a ten year-old is there, along with biting jokes for those geopolitically inclined. On a different level, Waititi The Director channels &lt;em&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; by showing us a world three feet high instead of six. Jojo Rabbit is a coming-of-age tale, with adults tugging at the strings of his life behind some curtain of maturity. These adults are sometimes imbeciles (low-level Nazi soldiers), sometimes courageous (Jojo’s mother [Scarlett Johannson]), and sometimes both depending on the situation (washed up Captain Klenzendorf [Sam Rockwell]). They operate formally in the adult realm, which inexorably approaches and darkens Jojo’s world throughout the film, but Waititi The Screenwriter manages to find great laughs in the childlike tendencies of even the Gestapo. This is not to say that the director makes fun of the culture of fear or terrible tragedy that infected Nazi Germany. He finds laughs in both dark and lighter moments by exposing the ridiculousness of Nazism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say this again: Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, sharing atmosphere with &lt;em&gt;The Grand Budapest Hotel&lt;/em&gt;. And it is because of this childlike urgency and earnestness that the emotional content impresses so thoroughly. It is every bit as solemn as *Budapest*’s gravest moments, without the reverence. The Gestapo comes, as it always does, for Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), a friend of Jojo’s dead sister living in her room. McKenzie packs emotion to spare. With tenuous power over Jojo as his physical and intellectual superior, she delivers stinging rebukes of Jojo’s indoctrination, while ultimately boxing herself up in his attic. This confinement heightens every interaction with her, and allows her to speak beyond her situation for people in hiding everywhere. Jojo Rabbit navigates conflicting ideas of right and wrong, exploiting the disagreements to heartbreaking, funny, or joyous ends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Parasite Refreshes Horror with a Hefty Dose of Social Realism</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/11/parasite-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/11/parasite-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 11/15/2019: check &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/parasite-refreshes-horror-with-a-hefty-dose-of-social-realism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; out at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No review—drawn inevitably from the vocabulary and lessons of preceding films—will do the novelty and creativity of Bong Joon-ho’s masterpiece justice. &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; is the best film to be released since &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt;, possibly since &lt;em&gt;12 Years a Slave&lt;/em&gt;. *Parasite*’s uncanny setting makes possible its combination of comedy and horror that justifies the second act’s shocking twists. In this way, it can be seen as the Korean and class counterpart to Get Out, with more emphasis on the realism than the horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is set in a contemporary Metropolis: its sprawling poverty serves the hermetically-sealed homes of the super-rich. Bong dances over the border between these realms, following—classically—the help that enters and exits these homes daily. In the title credits, we watch a drunk piss on the English basement-home of our star family, who are unemployed and failing to keep up with the vagaries of capitalism. When an unexpected chance to tutor at the home of a super-rich family opens, our family jumps at the opportunity. This first hour is a riot. Full of wit, we see them exploit the naïvete of the super-rich, locating the meaning behind ‘parasite’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But *Parasite*’s trick is its information imbalances. In Act I, our family colludes to carve out for themselves a way to live. Act II see-saws back this imbalance. Events begin to happen to our family rather than by our family. Still, Bong doesn’t shroud us in a JJ Abrams information fog, with terrors leaping out from dark corners of the screen. Instead, we see how the super-rich, themselves, feed off Korea’s underclass, dictating their schedule, their names, their words. Their financial insecurity keeps them in the thrall of this rich family, and pushes them to box out any competitors. These economically-violent delights have physically-violent ends. Where many films inspect class, the invisible fence that separates rich and poor, this film inspects wealth’s first derivative, inequality: we watch in real time as those invisible fences are built. &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; shows how the cherries that top the artisanal cakes drip with the blood of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distortion in Vertigo (1958)</title>
      <link>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/08/27/vertigo-1958/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/08/27/vertigo-1958/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 10/20/2019: check &lt;a href=&#34;https://popculturebento.com/the-all-american-gaze-distorted-perspective-in-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; out at &lt;em&gt;Pop Culture Bento&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitchcock’s cinematographic style changes with each script and year in which he immerses himself, unlike the storybook qualities of Wes Anderson or the placid &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/665415-drops-dripped-quiet-talk-went-on-horses-neighed-and-scuffled&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drops dripped&lt;/a&gt; of Andrei Tarkovsky. &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19078948&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dizzying heights&lt;/a&gt; of Hitchcock’s mastery, leads us into John Ferguson’s (James Stewart) mind&amp;mdash;distorted by the lethal, dozen-story fall of a partner trying to save Ferguson&amp;mdash;by forcing us into cramped spaces and mocking our spatial judgment. I argue that in doing so, Hitchcock forces viewers to understand the disorientation and claustrophobia that Ferguson so clearly feels. In doing so, Hitchcock makes reasonable the otherwise unreasonable male gaze of Ferguson and, by association, the effects that gaze causes, though it’s unclear whether it serves to morally justify that gaze. So, in-movie, Hitchcock uses film technique to warp what would otherwise be a black-and-white judgment about Ferguson’s behavior towards Judy Barton (Kim Novak).  Out-of-movie, I finally make the claim that this in-movie phenomenon critiques white American masculinity’s treatment of the Other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this analysis was impossible for me until I considered David Lynch’s &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;there were too many motifs in &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; to grab a hold of! Hitchcock employs a &lt;a href=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/514a2911e4b0896b36342655/1482995944327-EWLBUKOGUEVV2J7984Q3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDJVOyiZxV_-dowl7sRu02MUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYwL8IeDg6_3B-BRuF4nNrNcQkVuAT7tdErd0wQFEGFSnM_12NgTIazSm1At4R8ulVAcqDD8dBOmEycJv1fx_vd3MyvpBiIzzydoM1I6fLa65Q/image-asset.png?format=2500w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;contrasting color palette&lt;/a&gt;, his signature(ly disturbing) perplexion with blonde women, and an unforgettable break in narrative. &lt;em&gt;Mulholland&lt;/em&gt; offers those motifs amped up to surrealistic proportions, with color palettes at near antagonistic levels, the blondes shining ever more platinum, though its narrative break is difficult to pinpoint. Connecting &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; makes the interpretation of Hitchcock’s film no easier, but facilitates a shift in mindset that rendered Vertigo much more interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean this: Lynch is enigmatic as hell, but he continues to give interviews. In these interviews, he surrenders much of his creativity to what he terms “dream-logic”, and it stands out immediately. Dream-logic connects two objects despite their inconsistencies according to logic-logic. Such an approach finds its Western roots entirely recent, coming primarily out of Sigmund Freud’s &lt;em&gt;Interpretation of Dreams&lt;/em&gt;. Its epistemology is usually visual in [Lynch’s] movies, though connections via homonym or punnery are entirely within the bounds of Freudian analysis. While a novelty in 2001 &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt; premiered, 1958 saw psychoanalysis at its peak of influence. This rise crashed into Hitchcock’s prior work with film noir, convoluted plots that often involved damaged detectives and female subjects vulnerable physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; synthesizes these two strands. Kim Novak’s characters—one before, one after the narrative break—vie for their freedom against their supposed history. In classic Hitchcock fashion, &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; can be summarized as a Wrong Man Film,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:cf-The-Wrong-Man&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:cf-The-Wrong-Man&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where the protagonist is mistaken for a doppelgänger implicated in deep, deep shit. Unclassically, *Vertigo*’s protagonist is no man; and its protagonist(s) is/are not its central character(s). Novak’s Judy Barton is modeled (mostly) against her will after a prior, dead San Francisco socialite, Madeleine Ester,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Novak-in-Act-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Novak-in-Act-1&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who herself models a [much more] prior, dead San Francisco socialite. The complicity of each in creating their respective &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iron cloaks&lt;/a&gt; of identity is uncertain, but beside the point—Ferguson’s male gaze visualizes these identities before they are realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often enough, the male gaze is analyzed as a whole, apart from its sometimes very specific set of eyes. I get at Ferguson’s specific set through Hitchcock’s motifs and cinematography. Ferguson’s gaze is set very literally in the film’s opening. Hitchcock shakes up the presumably keen vision of a detective with his partner’s death. The fall and the height and the guilt confuse themselves in Ferguson’s head to deliver a crippling case of vertigo, rendering him unproductive and idle, unmoored from his former senses of intelligence. There is nothing objective against which Ferguson can mark the damage his trauma wrought, no other detectives to which he can compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitchock will signify this psychosis slowly at first, then all at once. This chronological pattern approximates the spiral imagery so fundamental to &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;. Saul Bass’ iconic movie poster design depicts Ferguson plunging into a line-drawn spiral. This third dimension is added, and reflects the way objects track in wide-diameter circles, speeding as the circles shrink and finally encloses the object.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Cf-This-comical&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Cf-This-comical&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Concerned of the obsession his wife (Madeleine) exhibits for a suicidal ancestor, Ferguson’s friend sends him to play private detective. While Scottie takes logical steps to follow the wife’s story, his social isolation and physical trauma get the better of him. His steps culminate in a famous leap into the brisk San Francisco Bay, where, just before, Madeleine plunged, unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ih-KeOf3xQQ/maxresdefault.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;*Vertigo*’s massive field of view.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the dive in, James Ferguson can never quite get himself on solid ground. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.abelardomorell.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2017_Flowers-For-Lisa-76-After-Hitchcock%E2%80%99s-Vertigo-2017-copy-1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;spiral patterns&lt;/a&gt; begin to crop up in paintings, department stores, cemeteries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I5ob7SqVmUQ/T1rcELu28SI/AAAAAAAACaM/bt6R6pd-4a0/s1600/Hitchcock+Vertigo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The tight spiral of Madeleine, her ancestor, and eventually Judy connects the three in Ferguson’s dream-logic.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught in the inner circles of a deepening plot and deepening conspiracy, Hitchcock simulates what Ferguson’s deepening psychosis&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; must feel like with cinematographic trickery that encloses Ferguson’s figure, disclosing the craze lurking inside his obsessed mind. In *Vertigo*’s camerawork, deep focus and a 2-D plane forces our visual cortex to compare the near and far. The video below demonstrates this several times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/bDwPJ5IaJ2g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those yellow flowers that Scottie walks behind at 1:59 appear taller than him in that moment, and the obscured view traps his figure in the history, mystery, and death that linger after Novak exits the scene. Hitchcock further unsettles viewers in :17, not with the normal technique of a dolly following Ferguson and suggesting danger, but with a shot from below. This camera setting exaggerates the height and length of objects outside focal point, making the 3ft flowers equal the 6ft Ferguson in height. The mastery here is the unresolved tension between these instances of camera trickery and Hitchcock’s concurrent attention to truly large objects. The enormity of the Golden Gate bridge in one famous shot anchors the nearly surreal imagery elsewhere in &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, cementing a permanent unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add this to the geologic folding that turns ordinary car following into labyrinthine mazes:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/fNyUpJGEnR4?t=73&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And of course, *Vertigo*’s signature camera effect, the zoom-in/dolly-out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/O888bu0QrMg?t=56&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The spirals (2:13), the huge objects (:36), the zoom-in/dolly-out (1:20) culminate in *Vertigo*’s quasi-climax:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/GjPCk494e5Q&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The scene in Mission San Juan Bautista also bears striking resemblances to the work of Italian surrealist Giorgio de Chirico. De Chirico’s work produces a sense of unease through its emphasis on the uncanny, that which is not quite and yet almost is. I like to think of a composite image, the subimages of which are all perfectly possible, though the composite somehow not being possible. In the image below, which reminds me both of the Mission and the ever-out-of-reach Madeleine, the sky is a natural color for sunsets and the long shadows possible at twilight, but the building is so bright and the shadows so stark that the image could not possibly depict a real event. Hitchcock, toeing the sur/realism line, never leaves us with quite the uncanny images or impossible geometries to prove the sort of dream-logic that Lynch would make explicit, but these scenes add up. With snaking streets, out-of-proportion objects, and color palette, builds a profile of the uncanny without ever letting us put a finger on it. Like Ferguson, the viewer is hard-pressed to resolve the visual inputs Hitchcock offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/Gou4x1ymnaWvmfhCgIsalNJKlyZ04HiczUsV3K7mJbNanian5d0xowY3sDAaWLcOUIwbbkvajPRVBCH9Zy8eBx5g/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Giorgio de Chirico&#39;s Metaphysical Art movement&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of confusion invites resolution for the viewer into a reality-less vacuum. Similarly, while Ferguson is a detective, used to getting to the Bottom of Things, he can’t in this situation. All his preternatural detective powers have been duped by trauma and deceit. He is painfully aware which way is up and which down, but not much beyond that. Through all the twists and turns, Ferguson never understands (or rather, never is able to convince himself he understands) Madeleine. The history (of Madeleine, of Dolores, etc.) regresses too far for his eyes to penetrate. Unable to free himself from this convoluted plot and detached from reality, Ferguson imposes a narrative on Judy. &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; now makes her tick. And the viewer accepts this to some degree because the story is resolution-deficient. Trapped staring through Ferguson’s gaze, escape is&amp;mdash;depending on the specific viewer&amp;mdash;to some extent preferable, even when it carries such gross implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endgame of Ferguson’s gaze is sex. The male gaze conjures scenarios&amp;mdash;no matter how fantastical&amp;mdash;where legally-consensual&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Otherwise-one-wo&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Otherwise-one-wo&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; sex occurs, and relates those scenarios with the real world in order to judge their plausibility, filtering those implausible scenarios from the gazer’s strategies. A plausible scenario would mean that Ferguson has successfully dissected her, inducting her motives, and&amp;mdash;with them in hand&amp;mdash;~smooth-talked~ her into thinking that his motives overlap with hers. But since Ferguson cannot understand Judy, because he cannot relate fantasy with reality, he resorts to the truly outrageous step of &lt;em&gt;realizing&lt;/em&gt; those fantastical scenarios and their absurd bargaining power disparities, molding Judy so that her [perceived] motives can be &lt;em&gt;induced&lt;/em&gt; to comport with Ferguson’s desires. This decision fabricates the conscience-satisfying, superficially-consensual sex that ends &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;. Horrifically, the viewers’ interests are sympathetic to Ferguson’s, begging for plot resolution, but are then [hopefully] spoiled when they are confronted with the idea that their interests imply the exploitation of Judy. From beneath the comfort of 1950’s American entertainment, a violent man watches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interpreting the greater significance of &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt;, I benefit again from viewing Hitchcock through Lynch’s rear window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be. But on the cherry tree there&amp;rsquo;s this pitch oozing out – some black, some yellow, and millions of red ants crawling all over it. I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; red ants underneath.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Lynch-David-and&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Lynch-David-and&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitchcock views America somewhat from the outside. He picks a very particular part of the US, one where the histories of people who were not British is readily apparent in depictions of frontier life (and Native death). This choice primarily works to operate on the level of uncanny history, a history that few are equipped to read completely into their own history of America, but with pieces that all can recognize. It’s therefore both easy to dissociate Ferguson’s particular position from their own, while difficult to completely disentangle the silver screen from real life. Stewart’s roles prior to &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; included US everyman turned Congressman in &lt;em&gt;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&lt;/em&gt;, aviator Charles Lindbergh in &lt;em&gt;The Spirit of St. Louis&lt;/em&gt;, a cowboy in &lt;em&gt;Winchester ‘73&lt;/em&gt;, George Bailey in &lt;em&gt;It’s a Wonderful Life&lt;/em&gt;. I cannot think of another actor who so embodied rich, moral American-ness during this time. Hitchcock then takes apart this rich, moral, American figure by finding within him obsession, formidable sexuality, and desperation. A bit of psychological trauma sets off (or reveals?) the ants in this cherry tree. &lt;strong&gt;More specifically, the bent of America is towards taking that which/who is not ours and assimilating them, without dealing with “underlying” issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it difficult to read Hitchcock as directing in so critical a fashion as I have just suggested, given the patent fetishism of Kim Novak’s characters. In that vein, I would echo the interpretation of American men above, but stop short of believing Hitchcock to be fully critical. For him, I don’t think the discomfort of Judy’s situation outweighs his fetish for Novak. While &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;/em&gt; is a unique instance of 1950’s filmmaking for its unsettling features and early integration of psychoanalysis, I’m not convinced of any allegations of intent on Hitchcock’s part. It very well may be that old Alfred was the astute critic I have made him to be, but it could equally (in my eyes) be the case that he was utterly obsessed with Novak. To resolve *Vertigo*’s interpretation would be to impose, for all but the most ardent individualist, an idea of its meaning absent context of its author. While I generally distance myself from arguments about authorial intent, I do not want to foreclose the possibility of its import to other viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;Note that this means thoughts become detached from external reality. When we understand that no person can diagnose another from anywhere but their own viewpoint firmly in the mainstream of productive society, it becomes clear that the usage of the word ‘reality’ is misleading. Reality does not exist&amp;mdash;it is judged to exist&amp;mdash;but always with psychology this judgment originates from the highly-educated professional class. Understanding what ‘external reality’ entails means Ferguson could both be “detached from external reality” and quite rational in both his and the viewers’ eyes. Hitchcock plays on this truth in many films. Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean somebody isn’t out to get you. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Note-that-this-m&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
