      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Runkel is a Research Associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability and Tobin Center Pre-Doctoral Fellow.
He&amp;rsquo;s interested in everything under the sun, though some things under the sun&amp;mdash;political economy, regional governance, and communication, for instance&amp;mdash;has held his interest longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corey uses this website to exercise his writing muscles, document his work, and spew the thoughts that occur to him while cooking pasta, climbing rocks, and riding his bike.&lt;/p&gt;
