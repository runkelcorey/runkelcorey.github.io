      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Runkel is a student at the University of Virginia and a Research Assistant at the Behavioral Research at Darden (BRAD) Lab. He finds himself down many a rabbit hole, but a few are longer than the rest, namely political economy and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corey uses this website to flex his writing muscles (the very same his elementary school teachers warned would wear out with disuse), document his work, and spew thoughts that occur to him while cooking pasta, climbing rocks, and distracting himself from whatever obstruse book is in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
