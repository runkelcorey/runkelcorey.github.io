Common metasyntactical variables, such as \u0026lsquo;John Doe\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;foobar\u0026rsquo;, depend on the country or discipline of origin When quoting, use \u0026ldquo;{quotation}\u0026rdquo; When referring to a term for its definition or linguistic/literary characteristics, use \u0026lsquo;{term}\u0026rsquo; Punctuation sits outside of both single and double quotation marks, unless it also occurs within such quotations When employing free indirect discourse it is appropriate to include a question mark without ending a sentence The Oxford comma creates ambiguities while clearing up none; it is disallowed Unless conflicting with the formatting of the \u0026lt;\u0026gt; quotation, notes within quotations should only occur as such: \u0026ldquo;[{note}]\u0026ldquo; Instead of double quotation marks, rarely used brackets in English (though often implemented in HTML), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;, denote terms that should be taken in another context, displacing quotation marks denoting distrust, sarcasm, or the inadequacy of language to convey full meanings  This blog was published on Hugo with Blogdown for R.
