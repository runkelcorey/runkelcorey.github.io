Waititi brings the fanaticism and anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany into close quarters by portraying Jojo’s imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler. His portrayal is an incredible use of dramatic irony: we see the craziness of Hitler’s cult of personality and ideology, while the ten year-old sees his idol. Same as any sports star, Jojo’s room is decked out in memorabilia and posters to the Führer’s power.\nWaititi The Actor mirrors Chaplin by lampooning Hitler’s decisions and imitating his manner of speech. All the silliness you’d expect from a ten year-old is there, along with biting jokes for those geopolitically inclined. On a different level, Waititi The Director channels Life is Beautiful by showing us a world three feet high instead of six. Jojo Rabbit is a coming-of-age tale, with adults tugging at the strings of his life behind some curtain of maturity. These adults are sometimes imbeciles (low-level Nazi soldiers), sometimes courageous (Jojo’s mother [Scarlett Johannson]), and sometimes both depending on the situation (washed up Captain Klenzendorf [Sam Rockwell]). They operate formally in the adult realm, which inexorably approaches and darkens Jojo’s world throughout the film, but Waititi The Screenwriter manages to find great laughs in the childlike tendencies of even the Gestapo. This is not to say that the director makes fun of the culture of fear or terrible tragedy that infected Nazi Germany. He finds laughs in both dark and lighter moments by exposing the ridiculousness of Nazism.\nLet me say this again: Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, sharing atmosphere with The Grand Budapest Hotel. And it is because of this childlike urgency and earnestness that the emotional content impresses so thoroughly. It is every bit as solemn as *Budapest*’s gravest moments, without the reverence. The Gestapo comes, as it always does, for Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), a friend of Jojo’s dead sister living in her room. McKenzie packs emotion to spare. With tenuous power over Jojo as his physical and intellectual superior, she delivers stinging rebukes of Jojo’s indoctrination, while ultimately boxing herself up in his attic. This confinement heightens every interaction with her, and allows her to speak beyond her situation for people in hiding everywhere. Jojo Rabbit navigates conflicting ideas of right and wrong, exploiting the disagreements to heartbreaking, funny, or joyous ends.\n","date":1575072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575139609,"objectID":"72063d537db5f69c97a85eec927d330b","permalink":"https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/30/jojo-rabbit-review/","publishdate":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/11/30/jojo-rabbit-review/","section":"post","summary":"Edit 11/30/2019: check this article out at Pop Culture Bento!\nImagine a Beaux Arts mashup of The Great Dictator and Life is Beautiful set inside a Moonrise Kingdom prequel.

There is the Massachusetts Bay colonizers, and the Virginia Company of London, more than anything else I want to race forward to 1776. American history teaching defaults to setting our cast of characters on the North American continent in order to reach revolution, with that noble end somehow justifying everything that came before (if not ethically, then morally: we suffered, and thus deserve Freedom). In the same way, the outposts of our frontiersmen and women served to legitimize the murder of indigenous people, conquest of Mexican territory, and deaths of our own colonizers.\nWhile this myth may be just that, it is a powerful story that is consistently told. Hughes rides its momentum, immediately clipping America\u0026rsquo;s great strides towards Freedom with the realities of chattel slavery. Nothing could be further from Freedom.

In this way, it can be seen as the Korean and class counterpart to Get Out, with more emphasis on the realism than the horror.\nThe film is set in a contemporary Metropolis: its sprawling poverty serves the hermetically-sealed homes of the super-rich. Bong dances over the border between these realms, following—classically—the help that enters and exits these homes daily. In the title credits, we watch a drunk piss on the English basement-home of our star family, who are unemployed and failing to keep up with the vagaries of capitalism. When an unexpected chance to tutor at the home of a super-rich family opens, our family jumps at the opportunity. This first hour is a riot. Full of wit, we see them exploit the naïvete of the super-rich, locating the meaning behind ‘parasite’.\nBut *Parasite*’s trick is its information imbalances. In Act I, our family colludes to carve out for themselves a way to live. Act II see-saws back this imbalance. Events begin to happen to our family rather than by our family. Still, Bong doesn’t shroud us in a JJ Abrams information fog, with terrors leaping out from dark corners of the screen. Instead, we see how the super-rich, themselves, feed off Korea’s underclass, dictating their schedule, their names, their words. Their financial insecurity keeps them in the thrall of this rich family, and pushes them to box out any competitors. These economically-violent delights have physically-violent ends. Where many films inspect class, the invisible fence that separates rich and poor, this film inspects wealth’s first derivative, inequality: we watch in real time as those invisible fences are built.

The only certainty is that I, in my manifold time management skills, will click on that link.\nI thought this was a phenomenon entirely local to myself until I saw this article from Aeon, noting that life management has become a juggernaut in consumer retail, with \u0026ldquo;self-care and anti-stress products now rounding out the bestseller list on Amazon\u0026rdquo;. We\u0026rsquo;ve reined in other animals, organizations of people, and our bodies by calibrating each measurable parameter, so why not do the same for our minds? Unfortunately, we don\u0026rsquo;t seem quite as pliant as the optimization equations imply.\nThis logic, made inexorable by limitless access to information, tugs at our happiness. Behind whatever tool or activity or person present before us lurks an alternative, a next-best option. This idea has driven every rationalist attempt at decision making, but its actual calculus has changed considerably since the 1990s. Before then, catalogued libraries and television delivered then-unprecedented access to information. The task of research had become immediately more accessible, but also less clear. Suddenly, more and more causes sprang up to explain each effect.\nThe move from card catalogues and TV to Wikipedia and on-demand streaming was a leap in this dimension. Different from past moves was the sheer scale of new information. The closest comparison to make would likely be the telegram that could relay news around the world in minutes, but that did not solve the last-mile problem that our phones and computers did. Similar to past moves is the growing illusion of choice. Most definitions model illusory choice as a free decision between a constrained set of options, like choosing from a soda machine that offers a dozen brands but where every choice is a Coca-Cola product. But rather than onstrained options, I interpret illusory choice as constrained decisions.\nOur brain budgets time and resources based on prior neurological sequences, updating expectations with each iteration. While we may understand how normal it is not to find an exhaustive cost-benefits comparison of the more than 2,000 results for \u0026ldquo;thimble\u0026rdquo; on Amazon, our brains may not. Our expectations have been conditioned by the norms of evidence-based administration to treat anything less than exhaustive comparisons as failure. This extends to our lives, where exhaustive comparison has meant nothing less than exhaustion. Where once, exhaustive comparisons meant eyeballing dozens, now it means eyeballing hundreds, thousands, or millions.\nOur internal search processes can\u0026rsquo;t handle such scale. While they have gradually widened, the velocity of extension by the market has effectively capped the rate at which we had to develop non-exhaustive ways to search. When the village had a single cobbler, shoes were a constant, not a variable to optimize over. Still, when there are ten types of black beans at the grocery store, they can be compared quite readily. But when it\u0026rsquo;s always possible to opt for peer-to-peer sellers in Kolkata over the ~local~ Walmart, people are given the room every day to exhaust their critical thinking skills trying to gauge the expected payoffs of a hundred options, and a million more they know to be lurking, accessible to anyone with the right search terms.\nOur minds haven\u0026rsquo;t caught up yet. They can take on waves of epic proportions, but a tide that lifts them high enough to see the world\u0026rsquo;s ginormity will overwhelm. I see two ways out: time and pragmatism. The first just says that after enough time passes, our minds will adjust, will think in different ways to approach this different problem. But that option offers only consolation to people currently. Option two offers that different way. Construct in your mind a noble lie, something appealing but fanciful. Then, believe in it.\nAdhering to a set of values fixes those variables as constants. This is Marie Kondo for your mind, with the tiny caveat that beliefs weigh far more than shower organizers, dressers, or homes. The values chosen don\u0026rsquo;t have to conform to Marie Kondo\u0026ndash;like advice. In fact, choosing something already at tension with what FastCompany promises are the best ways to increase productivity is probably best. It\u0026rsquo;s good training for the future. Rather, pick values that will let you do the most of your wants, your in-the-moment pleasures. Do not conflate \u0026lsquo;do the most\u0026rsquo; with \u0026lsquo;most choices\u0026rsquo;. To do the most, you need clear boundaries that, if crossed, bind you to decisions, decisions that you could theoretically even come to regret, but decisions that you need to make. Pragmatism means believing what needs to be believed, even if it can\u0026rsquo;t stand up to rationalist inquiry.\n","date":1573084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573142611,"objectID":"1db46beb856cb49888cfbbfeab69b993","permalink":"https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/11/07/aspirational-efficiency/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/11/07/aspirational-efficiency/","section":"post","summary":"The easiest way to derail any work that I am doing is by linking to an article ranking and comparing things that will help me live a better life.

Vertigo, at the dizzying heights of Hitchcock’s mastery, leads us into John Ferguson’s (James Stewart) mind\u0026mdash;distorted by the lethal, dozen-story fall of a partner trying to save Ferguson\u0026mdash;by forcing us into cramped spaces and mocking our spatial judgment. I argue that in doing so, Hitchcock forces viewers to understand the disorientation and claustrophobia that Ferguson so clearly feels. In doing so, Hitchcock makes reasonable the otherwise unreasonable male gaze of Ferguson and, by association, the effects that gaze causes, though it’s unclear whether it serves to morally justify that gaze. So, in-movie, Hitchcock uses film technique to warp what would otherwise be a black-and-white judgment about Ferguson’s behavior towards Judy Barton (Kim Novak). Out-of-movie, I finally make the claim that this in-movie phenomenon critiques white American masculinity’s treatment of the Other.\nMuch of this analysis was impossible for me until I considered David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive\u0026mdash;there were too many motifs in Vertigo to grab a hold of! Hitchcock employs a contrasting color palette, his signature(ly disturbing) perplexion with blonde women, and an unforgettable break in narrative. Mulholland offers those motifs amped up to surrealistic proportions, with color palettes at near antagonistic levels, the blondes shining ever more platinum, though its narrative break is difficult to pinpoint. Connecting Mulholland Drive and Vertigo makes the interpretation of Hitchcock’s film no easier, but facilitates a shift in mindset that rendered Vertigo much more interpretable.\nI mean this: Lynch is enigmatic as hell, but he continues to give interviews. In these interviews, he surrenders much of his creativity to what he terms “dream-logic”, and it stands out immediately. Dream-logic connects two objects despite their inconsistencies according to logic-logic. Such an approach finds its Western roots entirely recent, coming primarily out of Sigmund Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams. Its epistemology is usually visual in [Lynch’s] movies, though connections via homonym or punnery are entirely within the bounds of Freudian analysis. While a novelty in 2001 Mulholland Drive premiered, 1958 saw psychoanalysis at its peak of influence. This rise crashed into Hitchcock’s prior work with film noir, convoluted plots that often involved damaged detectives and female subjects vulnerable physically and mentally.\nVertigo synthesizes these two strands. Kim Novak’s characters—one before, one after the narrative break—vie for their freedom against their supposed history. In classic Hitchcock fashion, Vertigo can be summarized as a Wrong Man Film,1 where the protagonist is mistaken for a doppelgänger implicated in deep, deep shit. Unclassically, *Vertigo*’s protagonist is no man; and its protagonist(s) is/are not its central character(s). Novak’s Judy Barton is modeled (mostly) against her will after a prior, dead San Francisco socialite, Madeleine Ester,2 who herself models a [much more] prior, dead San Francisco socialite. The complicity of each in creating their respective iron cloaks of identity is uncertain, but beside the point—Ferguson’s male gaze visualizes these identities before they are realized.\nOften enough, the male gaze is analyzed as a whole, apart from its sometimes very specific set of eyes. I get at Ferguson’s specific set through Hitchcock’s motifs and cinematography. Ferguson’s gaze is set very literally in the film’s opening. Hitchcock shakes up the presumably keen vision of a detective with his partner’s death. The fall and the height and the guilt confuse themselves in Ferguson’s head to deliver a crippling case of vertigo, rendering him unproductive and idle, unmoored from his former senses of intelligence. There is nothing objective against which Ferguson can mark the damage his trauma wrought, no other detectives to which he can compare.\nHitchock will signify this psychosis slowly at first, then all at once. This chronological pattern approximates the spiral imagery so fundamental to Vertigo. Saul Bass’ iconic movie poster design depicts Ferguson plunging into a line-drawn spiral. This third dimension is added, and reflects the way objects track in wide-diameter circles, speeding as the circles shrink and finally encloses the object.3 Concerned of the obsession his wife (Madeleine) exhibits for a suicidal ancestor, Ferguson’s friend sends him to play private detective. While Scottie takes logical steps to follow the wife’s story, his social isolation and physical trauma get the better of him. His steps culminate in a famous leap into the brisk San Francisco Bay, where, just before, Madeleine plunged, unconscious.\nAfter the dive in, James Ferguson can never quite get himself on solid ground. The spiral patterns begin to crop up in paintings, department stores, cemeteries, etc.\nCaught in the inner circles of a deepening plot and deepening conspiracy, Hitchcock simulates what Ferguson’s deepening psychosis4 must feel like with cinematographic trickery that encloses Ferguson’s figure, disclosing the craze lurking inside his obsessed mind. In *Vertigo*’s camerawork, deep focus and a 2-D plane forces our visual cortex to compare the near and far. The video below demonstrates this several times.\n  Those yellow flowers that Scottie walks behind at 1:59 appear taller than him in that moment, and the obscured view traps his figure in the history, mystery, and death that linger after Novak exits the scene. Hitchcock further unsettles viewers in :17, not with the normal technique of a dolly following Ferguson and suggesting danger, but with a shot from below. This camera setting exaggerates the height and length of objects outside focal point, making the 3ft flowers equal the 6ft Ferguson in height. The mastery here is the unresolved tension between these instances of camera trickery and Hitchcock’s concurrent attention to truly large objects. The enormity of the Golden Gate bridge in one famous shot anchors the nearly surreal imagery elsewhere in Vertigo, cementing a permanent unease.\nAdd this to the geologic folding that turns ordinary car following into labyrinthine mazes:\n  And of course, *Vertigo*’s signature camera effect, the zoom-in/dolly-out:\n  The spirals (2:13), the huge objects (:36), the zoom-in/dolly-out (1:20) culminate in *Vertigo*’s quasi-climax:\n  The scene in Mission San Juan Bautista also bears striking resemblances to the work of Italian surrealist Giorgio de Chirico. De Chirico’s work produces a sense of unease through its emphasis on the uncanny, that which is not quite and yet almost is. I like to think of a composite image, the subimages of which are all perfectly possible, though the composite somehow not being possible. In the image below, which reminds me both of the Mission and the ever-out-of-reach Madeleine, the sky is a natural color for sunsets and the long shadows possible at twilight, but the building is so bright and the shadows so stark that the image could not possibly depict a real event. Hitchcock, toeing the sur/realism line, never leaves us with quite the uncanny images or impossible geometries to prove the sort of dream-logic that Lynch would make explicit, but these scenes add up. With snaking streets, out-of-proportion objects, and color palette, builds a profile of the uncanny without ever letting us put a finger on it. Like Ferguson, the viewer is hard-pressed to resolve the visual inputs Hitchcock offers.\nThis kind of confusion invites resolution for the viewer into a reality-less vacuum. Similarly, while Ferguson is a detective, used to getting to the Bottom of Things, he can’t in this situation. All his preternatural detective powers have been duped by trauma and deceit. He is painfully aware which way is up and which down, but not much beyond that. Through all the twists and turns, Ferguson never understands (or rather, never is able to convince himself he understands) Madeleine. The history (of Madeleine, of Dolores, etc.) regresses too far for his eyes to penetrate. Unable to free himself from this convoluted plot and detached from reality, Ferguson imposes a narrative on Judy. He now makes her tick. And the viewer accepts this to some degree because the story is resolution-deficient. Trapped staring through Ferguson’s gaze, escape is\u0026mdash;depending on the specific viewer\u0026mdash;to some extent preferable, even when it carries such gross implications.\nThe endgame of Ferguson’s gaze is sex. The male gaze conjures scenarios\u0026mdash;no matter how fantastical\u0026mdash;where legally-consensual5 sex occurs, and relates those scenarios with the real world in order to judge their plausibility, filtering those implausible scenarios from the gazer’s strategies. A plausible scenario would mean that Ferguson has successfully dissected her, inducting her motives, and\u0026mdash;with them in hand\u0026mdash;~smooth-talked~ her into thinking that his motives overlap with hers. But since Ferguson cannot understand Judy, because he cannot relate fantasy with reality, he resorts to the truly outrageous step of realizing those fantastical scenarios and their absurd bargaining power disparities, molding Judy so that her [perceived] motives can be induced to comport with Ferguson’s desires. This decision fabricates the conscience-satisfying, superficially-consensual sex that ends Vertigo. Horrifically, the viewers’ interests are sympathetic to Ferguson’s, begging for plot resolution, but are then [hopefully] spoiled when they are confronted with the idea that their interests imply the exploitation of Judy. From beneath the comfort of 1950’s American entertainment, a violent man watches.\nIn interpreting the greater significance of Vertigo, I benefit again from viewing Hitchcock through Lynch’s rear window:\n My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be. But on the cherry tree there\u0026rsquo;s this pitch oozing out – some black, some yellow, and millions of red ants crawling all over it. I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are always red ants underneath.6\n Hitchcock views America somewhat from the outside. He picks a very particular part of the US, one where the histories of people who were not British is readily apparent in depictions of frontier life (and Native death). This choice primarily works to operate on the level of uncanny history, a history that few are equipped to read completely into their own history of America, but with pieces that all can recognize. It’s therefore both easy to dissociate Ferguson’s particular position from their own, while difficult to completely disentangle the silver screen from real life. Stewart’s roles prior to Vertigo included US everyman turned Congressman in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, aviator Charles Lindbergh in The Spirit of St. Louis, a cowboy in Winchester ‘73, George Bailey in It’s a Wonderful Life. I cannot think of another actor who so embodied rich, moral American-ness during this time. Hitchcock then takes apart this rich, moral, American figure by finding within him obsession, formidable sexuality, and desperation. A bit of psychological trauma sets off (or reveals?) the ants in this cherry tree. More specifically, the bent of America is towards taking that which/who is not ours and assimilating them, without dealing with “underlying” issues.\nI find it difficult to read Hitchcock as directing in so critical a fashion as I have just suggested, given the patent fetishism of Kim Novak’s characters. In that vein, I would echo the interpretation of American men above, but stop short of believing Hitchcock to be fully critical. For him, I don’t think the discomfort of Judy’s situation outweighs his fetish for Novak. While Vertigo is a unique instance of 1950’s filmmaking for its unsettling features and early integration of psychoanalysis, I’m not convinced of any allegations of intent on Hitchcock’s part. It very well may be that old Alfred was the astute critic I have made him to be, but it could equally (in my eyes) be the case that he was utterly obsessed with Novak. To resolve *Vertigo*’s interpretation would be to impose, for all but the most ardent individualist, an idea of its meaning absent context of its author. While I generally distance myself from arguments about authorial intent, I do not want to foreclose the possibility of its import to other viewers.\n cf. The Wrong Man (1956) ^ Novak in ~Act 1~. ^ Cf. This comical image of a charity coin spinner, or how a gravity well may alter planetary orbits. ^ Note that this means thoughts become detached from external reality. When we understand that no person can diagnose another from anywhere but their own viewpoint firmly in the mainstream of productive society, it becomes clear that the usage of the word ‘reality’ is misleading. Reality does not exist\u0026mdash;it is judged to exist\u0026mdash;but always with psychology this judgment originates from the highly-educated professional class. Understanding what ‘external reality’ entails means Ferguson could both be “detached from external reality” and quite rational in both his and the viewers’ eyes. Hitchcock plays on this truth in many films. Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean somebody isn’t out to get you. ^ Otherwise, one would have no need for fantasizing. ^ Lynch, David and Rodley, Chris (2005).
