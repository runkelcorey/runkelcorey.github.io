The intervening years saw the Brit direct almost all of the films for which he is so well remembered today, including Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, North by Northwest, and Psycho. 1958\u0026rsquo;s Vertigo, however, has long been considered the absolute maximum of Hitchcock\u0026rsquo;s directorial function. I subjected myself to the movie at least three different times to understand its value among critics, but it is a seriously difficult film to approach: the film splits into two parts with the death of James Stewart\u0026rsquo;s love interest (Kim Novak), a woman whose doppelgänger (also portrayed by Novak) shows her face in the second half; the casting of James Stewart\u0026mdash;with lead roles in It\u0026rsquo;s a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\u0026mdash;in lieu of transatlantic Hitchcock favorite Cary Grant, reads as an intentional subversion of 1950s Americana; and the director\u0026rsquo;s artistic relationship with blonde women has colored the film a million shades by a million viewers. It was not until I had watched some of Vertigo\u0026rsquo;s descendants, notably David Lynch\u0026rsquo;s Mulholland Drive that I felt the impact for which I had longed upon re-watching the film this summer.\nHitchcock\u0026rsquo;s cinematographic style change with each movie he makes, unlike the storybook qualities of Wes Anderson or the placid \u0026ldquo;Drops dripped.\u0026rdquo; of Andrei Tarkovsky. In Vertigo, he leads us into James Stewart\u0026rsquo;s distorted mind, a world shattered by the traumatic death of his police force\u0026ndash;partner, by constricting our range of movement and mocking our spatial judgment. The partner falls from a San Francisco tenement while trying to save James Stewart, and suddenly, like Kim Novak\u0026rsquo;s character in double, Stewart\u0026rsquo;s steps into another\u0026rsquo;s life. This life is more traumatically metaphorical and very much less literal than that of Kim Novak\u0026rsquo;s character, but another life nonetheless. The fall and the height and the guilt confuse themselves in Stewart\u0026rsquo;s head to deliver him a crippling case of Vertigo, forcing him from the force for good.\nStewart\u0026rsquo;s friend exacerbates this confusion by sending him to surveil the friend\u0026rsquo;s wife, Novak\u0026rsquo;s original character. Such a clandestine project leads Stewart through the winding streets and seemingly circular history of San Francisco, where his friend\u0026rsquo;s wife has taken to emulating a crazed ancestor\u0026rsquo;s appearance. At this point, Hitchcock begins to insert spiral patterns everywhere. This pattern symbolizes the deepening plot, deepening conspiracy1, and deepening psychotic hole that Stewart finds his character in. The symbolism is patent, however, contrasting with other imagery employed by the director (imagery which would find amplification in what Lynch described as \u0026ldquo;dream logic\u0026rdquo;).\nAlfred Hitchcock\u0026rsquo;s cinematographical trickery encloses James Stewart\u0026rsquo;s all-American character, disclosing the craze lurking inside his obsessed mind. With deep focus and a 2-D plane, cameras make the near and far appear unified. The video below2 demonstrates this several times. The whole video is a smörgåsbord of labyrinths, San Francisco history, and voyeurism, but turn the clock to 1:59 to see the images I can\u0026rsquo;t remove from my head.\n  Those yellow flowers that James Stewart walks behind appear taller than him in that moment, and the obscured view traps his figure in the history, mystery, and death that linger after Novak exits the scene. Hitchcock further unsettles viewers in :17, not with the normal technique of a dolly following Stewart and suggesting danger, but by a shot from below. This camera setting exaggerates the heights and lengths of objects outside focal point, making the 3ft flowers equal the 6ft Stewart in height. But the mastery here is the unresolved tension between these instances of camera trickery and Hitchcock\u0026rsquo;s usage of truly large objects. The enormity of the Golden Gate bridge in one famous shot anchors the nearly surreal imagery elsewhere in Vertigo, cementing a permanent unease throughout.\n Remember Hitchcock overlaps with noir films, from which he pulls much of his plot devices and motifs. ^ Massive apologies for the aspect ratio, look for higher quality clips to see how wide the film really looks. ^   ","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566935651,"objectID":"7277e63f4c9d1cbea361962640df6c33","permalink":"https://runkelcorey.github.io/2019/08/27/vertigo-1958/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/08/27/vertigo-1958/","section":"post","summary":"Alfred Hitchcock\u0026rsquo;s golden decade began in 1954 with Dial M for Murder, and ended with The Birds in 1963.
